**Please note, there are some mock interviews and videos of current students talking about why they chose Cambridge which are all made by Emmanuel students on [this youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYPIjZXnaJ736LyDUIjv5fQ).**

If you have any questions about admissions  or Cambridge in general there are a number of people you can contact.

## General &amp; Specific Admissions Enquiries

General and specific admissions enquiries should be addressed in the first instance to Miss Lesley Shaw, the Emmanuel College Admissions Officer.

## Freshers Reps

All admissions and academic enquires should be sent to the Admissions Officer. However for more trivial enquires and advice on college / student life, accommodation selection, hall food etc., the Freshers Reps will be more than happy to answer questions.


## Access Officer

Throughout the year the ECSU Access Officer will also be willing to answer any queries about the application process and Cambridge life in general.


## University Admissions Policy &amp; Questions

Matters of University, rather than College, admissions policy should be directed to the Cambridge Admissions Office (CAO).
