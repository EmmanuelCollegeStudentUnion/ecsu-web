Once you go through a few prospectuses, you realise that every college calls itself 'friendly' at some point, and Emma is no exception. However, life at Emma genuinely is friendly thanks partly to the best and cheapest bar in Cambridge, a wealth of societies, and a shared appreciation of our beloved ducks.

## Societies and Sport

It's really easy to get involved in societies, simply because there are so many! If you're into music, there's the choir, the music society, and there are rooms with pianos and drums available to hire. There's REDS, our drama society, who put on several productions a year, and there's ECAPS (Emmanuel College Art and Photography Society) for the creative people among us.

## Entertainment in Emma

During term Emma hosts our own regular club night: Emma Ents, a popular night featuring accomplished DJs playing whole range of music styles from Afrobeat to Drum'n'Bass to Hip Hop. In our old library we hold jazz nights, and then 2 or 3 times a term, the notorious bar extensions, featuring cheesy music, fancy dress and themed drinks deals.

## Cambridge Clubs

Cambridge itself has 4 main clubs. Although cheese is undeniably the favoured music style among students, it's easy to avoid if it's not your thing and there are loads of different venues offering different music styles.
