Coming from London, I have to say that coming to Cambridge was a bit of a culture shock - although there are definitely fewer ethnic minorities (especially black people) here, its so much more diverse than home - bringing people from different countries and different backgrounds together. What's so great about colleges is that you don't really feel like part of a minority - people are so friendly and accepting that most of the time you don't feel like you stick out. Nevertheless, people can and do feel isolated when they're the only black or asian or muslim student in their college because it's nice to sometimes spend time with someone who comes from a similar background - and in understanding this, there are loads of university societies where you can meet people and share an appreciation of your culture. The Black and Asian Caucus is probably the biggest society that caters for ethnic minorities. It runs all kinds of socials throughout the year - club nights, garden parties, and so on, that are great fun, but there are a whole range of smaller international societies such as IndiaSoc, J-Soc (the Jewish Society), the African Caribbean Society, and the Nigerian Society that offer support and friendship and a forum for celebrating whatever festival/religious event/special day with other people. Cambridge is a great place to meet all sorts of people, and that's one of its strengths.
