title: Ski Trip
---

As past participants will know the Emma ski trip is the perfect start to the Lent term, after a week spent carving up the mountains you'll return to College tanned, possibly sore, but definitely acclimatised to the chilly spring ahead. It's also a great way to spend some quality time on and off the slopes with people from college, without any Cambridge stress.
This year's trip promises to be no exception. Come join us between 3rd - 10th of January 2009 in Tignes Val Claret, part of the world-renowned ski area Espace de Killy. With over 300 kilometres of pisted skiing awaiting you from our ski in/ski out accommodation it offers the perfect playground for all abilities: from the beginners who'll appreciate wide sweeping runs to advanced skiers and snowboarders who want to explore new challenges on and off piste.
The basic holiday price is Â£297 (cheaper than Varsity!) for which you get luxury return coach travel from Cambridge/ London or Dover, 7 nights accommodation, a full lift pass as well as a fully loaded social itinerary in the lively resort of Val Claret plus a free T-shirt! Equipment hire and lessons cost a bit extra. There's also a staggered payment facility, meaning it's shouldn't be too much of a burden on your student loan all at once!
If we've won you over already, you can book online here by entering the booking code ws09emmanuel.
We'll be at the Freshers' fair and hosting a squash later on this term. If you have any questions, just come along and say hello, spot us in college or email us at emmanuelskitrip@googlemail.com.
