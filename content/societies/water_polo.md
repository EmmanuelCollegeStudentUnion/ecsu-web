 Emmanuel College Swimming and Water Polo Club provides an opportunity to play water polo matches a few times a term in the college league. Also called 'water YOLO' these are short and fun (we train in the game), and anyone is welcome to try and join in. 
 There is also a intercollegiate swimming gala held at the start of Lent term, in which Emma came 4th last year!
