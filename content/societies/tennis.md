The Emmanuel College Tennis Club caters for all abilities. In the Summer
term we enter ladies and mens teams into both the university wide league
and the Cuppers tournment. We also organise practices for the teams and for
anyone else that wants to play.
 The college has three hard courts and four
grass courts at the Wilberforce Road playing fields which college members
are free to use at any time. Also, during summer term, three grass courts
are erected on the Emmanuel paddock for the use of anyone that fancies a
hit. Rackets and balls can be borrowed from the porter's lodge.
