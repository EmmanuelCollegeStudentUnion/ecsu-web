title: ERICS | Ice Cream Society
---

We are a group of students at Cambridge University, mostly but not all from Emmanuel College. We are disillusioned with the quality of British ice cream, and after a visit to Italy in which we saw how ice cream ought to be, we formed the society at the beginning of the academic year 2003-4.
We are actively engaged in 'promozione fare e consumo del gelato reale' which we are told is the translation into Italian of 'promoting the making and eating of real ice cream'. We meet up whenever we feel like we ought to, and make our own ice cream, which is usually eaten within the next few days.
