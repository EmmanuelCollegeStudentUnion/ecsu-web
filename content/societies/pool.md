The Pool Club is involved in Cambridge's inter-collegiate leagues each year. Usually, two teams are each entered into a league and cup competition for the year. The six-person teams are unisex and selection is based on ability and availability.
Matches typically take place once a fortnight during the first two terms, in the evening. Matches are best of nine frames, with each player participating in a singles frame and a doubles frame. Matches normally last between ninety minutes and three hours. Players can leave if necessary once they've played their games, but usually everyone hangs around to cheer team-mates on and sometimes to have a celebratory drink in the bar afterwards.
The team are currently in division 1a. Home matches are played on the MCR pool table.
The club also has strong links with the university wide pool club, CUPC.
