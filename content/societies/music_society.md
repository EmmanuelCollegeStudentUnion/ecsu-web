Emmanuel College Music Society is one of the oldest and largest in 
Cambridge, and as such has something for everyone to enjoy! We run a 
weekly recital series at 9pm on Sundays which attracts some of the top 
performers from Cambridge, as well as running many ensembles that Emma 
students can get involved with:

Emma Jazz - a high standard auditioned jazz band who perform a large 
variety of music at events throughout Cambridge

Emma Big Band - a non-auditioned, lower commitment jazz band who play 
music from Frank Sinatra to Beyonce and perform for various events at 
Emma and elsewhere

Emma Chorus - a non-auditioned bunch of fun loving singers who get 
together on Monday evenings and perform in the end of term concerts

Folk Band - rehearsing on Sunday evenings, the folk band performs in 
multiple ceilidhs each term

Orchestra - a fun, friendly, non-auditioned ensemble of players from 
across the university, largely Emma, who rehearse weekly on Sunday 
afternoons and perform a combination of classical favourites and film 
classics in end of term concerts
