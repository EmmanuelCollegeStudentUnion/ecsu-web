Emmanuel College Hockey Club is involved in Men's, Women's and Mixed matches both in the Inter-collegiate league and the Cupper's tournament.
Matches take place in Michaelmas and Lent terms. It's a great way to meet other people, go out on decent socials, and get involved with Emmanuel life. Players from all ability ranges are strongly invited to get involved! Last year several players joined us, having never touched a hockey stick, and are now regular players; so why not give it a go? Hockey will generally take an average of three hours of your week, but it's good fun and will keep you fit!
For more information contact Hayley Hardstaff(hh424), Emma Charlton (ec563) or Theo St John-Stevens (ts614). Search for 'Emmanuel College Hockey' on Facebook to join the group.
