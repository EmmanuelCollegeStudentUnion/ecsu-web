The Emmanuel College Cricket Club provides undergraduates and graduates of the college to play cricket from the end of Lent term through to the end of Easter term. The team takes part in the inter-collegiate knockout 'Cuppers' Twenty20 tournament as well as organized friendly matches. There is also an annual match versus the Old Boys.
The facilities available to the club at Wilberforce Road sports grounds include three outdoor nets and a well-maintained ground with a good wicket. There are also indoor facilities at Fenner's Sports where winter training can be held. The club also has a team kit so members can borrow batting gear but if you already have your own, bring it along.
There is a varied level of ability in the squad so everyone who would like to play should get involved. There will be opportunities for everyone. There is also a good team spirit and social side to playing to cricket at Emmanuel, with regular socials including post match team dinners.
For more information, contact club captain Luke Hone.
