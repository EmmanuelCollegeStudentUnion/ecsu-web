Whether you're an experienced player looking to play in the college league, or just want to play casually with your friends, we have something for players of all abilities. We meet a few times a term for casual games or training sessions and also enter teams in the college league (with the 1st team coming 3rd in division 1 last year).
This year's captains are Robert Starley (rs749) and Ralph Jordan (rwj25) for the 1st and 2nd teams respectively - we're always happy to hear from new players interested in joining.
