Emma is one of the Greenest colleges in Cambridge and this is being increasingly reflected in the actions of students and staff around the College. 
The Green Society, aka the Green Ducks as it is often known, is made up of a dedicated group of students that are passionate about improving the environmental sustainability of the college. The Society is run by the Green and Ethical Officer who holds weekly-fortnightly meetings to discuss events and initiatives to run each term. 
Previous events include the annual Vintage Fashion Fair, vegetarian formal and speakers' talks by knowledgeable Green-minded individuals. In Lent 2016, the Green Society ran the college's first ever Environ-ENT which was a huge success and raised Â£75 for Amnesty International from the proceeds of a Green and Ethical-themed quiz. 
This year, the Green Society has been embarking on the Green Impact Award scheme and managed to complete over 40 tasks in the workbook that should hopefully lead to a Silver Award for the College in the summer (fingers crossed). Initiatives to reach this target have included putting recycling stickers on all undergraduate bins, re-vamping the college Green boards and liaising with multiple members of staff on the college's environmental policy.
The Green Society is happy to welcome new members at any point in the year who are passionate about the environment and improving the quality of life in the college. It is a really fun way of changing the college for the better and making some friends in the process.
If you are interested in being involved, please contact the Green and Ethical Officer, Aoife Blanchard, who will be happy to answer any questions.
