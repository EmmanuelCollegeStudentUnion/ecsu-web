ECAPS is Emmanuel's Art and Photography society. Since the formation of the society in 2011, ECAPS has hosted many events in and out of college for its members and for anyone in the college to get involved with such as photography walks, origami classes, light painting, collaging, holiday themed workshops and more! Our events are open to college members of any experience level and we try to teach new skills. Members are encouraged to host their own events which ECAPS can help you organise.
We do a lot of work with our societies such as providing photographers, charity work, and creating the image for the front of annual college magazine in 2015 and 2016.
