Emma Badminton is open to all players from complete novice to university level. We have weekly training sessions - consisting of lots of games to learn the rules and try out tactics - for everyone to come along to and then in addition have court time for players who want to play matches in the college men's and women's doubles league which is itself fairly relaxed. We have currently two men's team (6 players in a team plus subs) and one women's team in competitive but fun divisions. We may not come out on top but we haven't dropped to the bottom! We also play mixed doubles in lent term. So if you fancy playing badminton (and going to the bar after training), meeting more people and sometimes beating other colleges - Emma Badminton Club is for you!
For more information please contact the President Jade Doughty (jd652), Men's First Captain Barnaby Stonier (bjs51), Men's Second Captain (mj434) and Ladies Captain Arita Acharya (aa790).
