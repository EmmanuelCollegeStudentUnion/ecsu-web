Emmanuel College Amnesty International is a group of people that come together to support human rights: internationally and locally! The group is run by the college representatives for Amnesty, who are also involved with the University Amnesty International group.
What we do: letter writing sessions, fundraising to help the university campaign, petition signing, or film screenings. If you are passionate about something in particular like LGBT+ rights, the refugee crisis or the death penalty, the group can take it forward!
This year, Amnesty International has been very busy. We had a fundraising bake sale as part of Vintage Fashion Fair, raising Â£33 for the University Amnesty group supporting Cambridge Refugee Charity CUCRAG, as well as three letter writing sessions resulting in 10 letters supporting human rights causes globally.
Join the facebook group to stay updated with related events going on in college and Cambridge!
