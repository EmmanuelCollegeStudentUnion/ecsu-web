 In Emmanuel college we have 2 squash courts on the main college site, these are available to book out from the porters lodge making casual squash very accessible to all in college. There is more organised squash within college through the college squash ladder. In addition to this, the college has either 2 or 3 squash teams depending on interest. These teams play in the 7 intercollegiate squash leagues. The first team are currently in division 2 and the second team are in division 4. The teams also compete in cuppers each year. College squash is great fun and is a great way to meet new people in college and to have a good time with your mates.
