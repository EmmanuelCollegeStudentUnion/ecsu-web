Hey everyone, my name's Dan (he/him) and I'm the new Male Welfare Officer. My role is to ensure there's somebody in college who's there for you to talk to who will provide confidential support,
to signpost you to the welfare services the university has to offer, and also to organise events throughout term to help you unwind and feel better!
I can be contacted at ds783@cam.ac.uk or welfare-male@ecsu.org.uk to arrange a meeting or to ask questions, or you can submit an anonymous welfare message via the ecsu website. Looking forward to a great year!
