Hi, I’m Vedanth Nair (he/him), I’m a 2nd year economist, and I’m from King’s Lynn in Norfolk.
As treasurer, it's my role to allocate ECSU funding to societies within college and to support the rest of the ECSU committee.
Society funding opens at the beginning of each term for about a week. If you have any questions, either find me on Facebook or email me at vn265@cam.ac.uk
