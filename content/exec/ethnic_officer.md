Hi all! My name is Hao Zhe (not Hao) and I use he/him pronouns.

										As the BME officer, I work to provide welfare support for BME students in Emma!
										That includes any college-related issues, events,
										socials or something you want to bring up to ECSU Committee/College.

										Aside from welfare, I am also involved in liberation campaigns such as the BME Access scheme,
										so drop me a message (hzc20) if you're interested in contributing!
