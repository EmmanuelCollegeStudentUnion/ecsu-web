Iâ€™m Chloe (she/her), a second year EED student, and your current disabilities officer.
										I work to make Emmanuel a more accessible and comfortable place for students who self-identify as disabled.
										As a student with clinical anxiety, I am particularly eager to work on the rights of students with invisible disabilities,
										but I would love to hear from all students about their needs. If you have any suggestions, problems or just want a chat,
										contact me at cl723 or Facebook me!
