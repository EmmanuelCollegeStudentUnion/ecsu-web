I'm Simina (she/her), a 2nd year studying Education and German. I lived in different places across the years
									  and I think that my main role will be to make sure everyone feels at home and included in the Emma community.
										I'm also passionate about the problems international students face before coming to College as I've been one of the ifreps.
										I'm happy to be contacted whenever on sd756, but people can also drop stuff in my pidge as I check it regularly.
