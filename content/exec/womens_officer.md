Hi I'm Lydia (she/her) and Iâ€™m the women's officer for ECSU 2018. I'm here to offer advice on any gendered issues anyone might be facing, but please use womens@ecsu.org.uk (rather than Facebook) and from there we can arrange a meeting.
This year I also will be - planning bi weekly women and non-binary students only meeting / events - Organising research and celebration of the 40th anniversary of women being accepted into Emmanuel (2019)
- Continually assessing the colleges' policy towards women's issues, particularly its sexual assault policy and financial policy towards sexual assault care - Supporting ECSU in their living wage campaign,
particularly thinking about the large quantity of female staff Emmanuel employs Please send me an email if you have any questions or suggestions , looking forward to working with you all!
