I’m Caitlin (she/her), the female welfare officer, and my role is to offer support and improve the wellbeing of Emma’s undergraduates. Working alongside Dan, we’ll be co ordinating various weekly welfare events,
										as well as always being available for personal help and advice. Feel free to come to me with anything that might be going on with you as I will always want to help,
										although as an initial point of contact please reach me via email (welfare-female@ecsu.org.uk or on cc885@cam.ac.uk) as opposed to Facebook messenger.
										From there we can arrange a time and place to meet, for meetings of no longer than an hour at a time. I’m very excited to get started and continue the great work of previous welfare officers.
