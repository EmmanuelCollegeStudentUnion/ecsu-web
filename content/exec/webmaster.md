Hi! My name is Matteo (he/him), I am a second year CompSci, and I will be your Webmaster this year. My job involves taking care of the ECSU website and other tech-related things,
as well as working on new developments – for example, I will be making an app for Emma together with a team of a few friends.
I always welcome feedback, whether it’s about the website, or indeed if there are specific features you would like to see in the app!
Just let me know by emailing me (mgp35) or messaging me on Facebook. Cheers
