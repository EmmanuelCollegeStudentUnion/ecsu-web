Iâ€™m Matilda (she/her), a second year classicist, as Vice President my job is to be a primary point of contact between students, college staff and CUSU. I also organise events like Halfway hall and Hustings.
										I really hope to improve college life for everyone, while maintaining the friendly Emma atmosphere! If you have any suggestions or problems, please contact me at vicepresident@ecsu.org.uk
