Hi All! I am Josh (he/him), a second year Politics and International Relations student, and I
		am very excited to be your Career and Education officer for this year! Beside academia, I
		have been working with numerous think tanks, assisted running an MPs office, and
		completed a summer internship with a Big Four accounting firm. I also enjoy playing
		basketball in the college league and learn about innovative policy solutions.
My main task is to ensure that you receive as much support in your academic and
		professional life as you possibly can. On the education side, making the transition from high
		school to Cambridge, and later, to exam term smooth and stress-free. On the career side, I
		firmly believe finding the right career should not be based on a single organisation selecting
		us, but it has a great importance that each of us finds the most fitting job. It is now our
		responsibility to get to know those organisations which are the best for us. I am committed
		to help you finding your opportunities. I also make sure that our library functions well and
		provides a comforting (and comfortable) space for studying on the way.
Throughout the year, look out for our main career events in Lent and Michaelmas organised
		together with our alumni organisation, the Emmanuel Society, as well as for CV and LinkedIn
		polishing sessions and thematic, sector-specific workshops. I also hope that you will find the
		online interview partner searcher and the subject-focused exam guides helpful.
To keep in touch, please message me on my Hermes with any questions or
		suggestions you might have! I wish to make efficient dialogues with college through listening
		to your needs and creating innovative solutions. To learn about new events and resources,
