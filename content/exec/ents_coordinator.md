Hey all, we are delighted to be your Ents Officers for this coming year. Our primary aim is to make Emma Ents great again.
										We think we can achieve this is through the introduction of our new event, âSuperEntsâ, which will feature external DJs and hopefully provide many memorable nights.
										We are also keen to expand the remit of the role by organising more intra college activities including a karaoke night, pub quizzes and sporting competitions.
When we arenât working incredibly hard at our degrees, we love our music and playing sport.
										Message or email us with any questions or suggestions you have or feel free to stop us in person to have a chat.
Ents Love, Mojo (he/him) and Ashwin (he/him)
