The Cambridge Climate and Sustainability Festival 2019 is a one-day festival organised by a group of Cambridge University students and run in partnership with the Cambridge Hub. The Festival is aimed at increasing awareness of climate change, sustainability and 21st Century environmental challenges, motivating people to take unilateral and collective action.

With a theme of “Affecting Every Existence”, there will be something for everyone to learn about how sustainability affects all aspects of society, from science to charity (Craig Bennett OBE, CEO: Friends of the Earth) to community action (Dr Cameron Brick, psychology and communication of ’sustainability’) to art (Rachael Pimm). Each panel discussion will engage us about how climate change will affect everyone, and that every one of us can save countless lives by playing our part.

Tickets have been released! Secure your ticket now for £5/ £7 (Student/ Non-Student), through the link on the Facebook page linked below. Click ‘going' to stay up-to-date with the latest updates for the day: https://www.facebook.com/events/759733801060034/
