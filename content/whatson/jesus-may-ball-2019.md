There are a variety of roles available, including Food and Drink workers, Security Stewards, and Entertainment Runners, as well as opportunities to take on a leadership position as a Team Leader or Court Supervisor. Previous experience in hospitality or May Balls is not essential for most roles.

Jesus do not offer a half on / half off option, but all staff get breaks during the event in which they will be allowed to explore the Ball and sample the food and drink on offer.
