Adaptive Brain Lab are looking for paid volunteers for 3 studies that will take place in January and February. 

1. 'Mechanisms of predictive learning' 
2. Brain Stimulation Study: Who Moved the Object?
3. Brain Scan & Stimulation Studies: Memory for Objects

Further information Study 1: 

In this study you will be required to do a visual task on a computer. This will consist of 4 one-hour sessions which are conducted on separate days at the Adaptive Brain Lab (2nd floor Craik Marshall Building), you will be reimbursed for your time (**£7 per hour**). Following the behavioural part you will be asked to undergo one or two MRI scanning (in case you will need to do two scanning sessions, those will occur in two separate days), each of them lasting approximately 2 hours. For the scanning session you will be reimbursed for your time **£10 per hour**, plus **£5** for transport to and from WBIC Addenbroke's, where the scanning sessions will take place. 

If you are interested in the study, please send an email to psycabgr@hermes.cam.ac.uk with the subject 'Mechanisms of Predictive Learning'.



Further information Study 2:

Complete a simple questionnaire and a computer-based task after non-invasive brain stimulation, which is commonly used to temporarily affect brain activity (i.e. for the duration of each session). These will take place over 2 60 to 90 minute sessions at the Adaptive Brain Lab, Downing Site, Central Cambridge. You will be reimbursed £30.

If you are interested or have any questions, please feel free to contact the researcher (smk63@cam.ac.uk).

Session 1: Stay still inside the Magnetic Resonance Imaging machine for about 1 hour, at the Cognitive Brain Science Unit.

Session 2-5: Complete a simple questionnaire and a computer-based task after non-invasive brain stimulation, which is commonly used to temporarily affect brain activity (i.e. for the duration of each session). Each of these sessions take place at the Adaptive Brain Lab, Downing Site, Central Cambridge, and last between 1-1.5 hours.

Reimbursement: £67.5 + an image of your brain
