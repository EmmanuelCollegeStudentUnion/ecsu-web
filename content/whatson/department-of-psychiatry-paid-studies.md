The Department of Psychiatry is looking for volunteers to participate in a decision-making study. They are trying to understand the effects of sounds on shopping choices among people with autism or Asperger Syndrome.

They are looking for both adults (18+) with a diagnosis of autism or Asperger Syndrome and a comparison group of adults without autism. To take part, you should have corrected-to-normal vision and hearing.

The study involves different tasks including answering questions about your autism (if applicable), completing some puzzles and questionnaires, and having your heart rate measured. There is also a decision-making task during which we will ask you to make shopping choices whilst listening to different sounds. This research has the potential to influence Autism Friendly Hour, an initiative involving shops altering the sounds and brightness in their stores to reduce sensory overload.

This study is based at Douglas House, in Cambridge. It will take around 2.5 hours for people without autism and around 4 hours for people with autism. There will be breaks and refreshments. We will pay you Â£40 for taking part, and 2nd Class rail (or equivalent car) expenses.

If you are interested in our study, or have any questions, please contact Rachel Bellamy on autismdecisionmakingstudy@gmail.com
