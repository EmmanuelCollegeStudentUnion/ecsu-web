The Adaptive Brain Lab is currently looking for participants to take part in one of two studies:

1) EEG and visual learning: This study is investigating how our brain activity changes when we are learning to discriminate new visual objects. The study lasts for up to three sessions, and pays £8/hour. Sessions 1 and 3 last for 45-60 minutes and involve a variety of computer-based visual tasks. Session 2 will include EEG measures to monitor your brain activity, and will last up to 2.5 hours (including preparation time for the EEG equipment).

To get more info or to volunteer for this study, please contact the lab at psycabgr@hermes.cam.ac.uk, with email subject "EEG_learning"

2) MRI, brain stimulation and visual learning: This study investigates how the brain learns to discriminate objects that are difficult to see. You would participate in two sessions: 1 hour of computer-based tasks in our lab, and a 2 hour MRI scan with brain stimulation in which you would do a visual task. In total the study pays £30, plus a picture of your brain to take away with you. 

To get more info or to volunteer for this study, please contact the lab at psycabgr@hermes.cam.ac.uk, with email subject "MR_VISLEARN_1819"
