Fancy spending your summer experiencing Chinese culture and learning mandarin for free? 

This is a summer cultural exchange program where you will live with a Chinese host family and teach their children English for 6 weeks or more. In exchange you receive FREE return flights, mandarin lessons, cultural experiences, full-board accommodation and training. Optional time to travel at the end of the program.
