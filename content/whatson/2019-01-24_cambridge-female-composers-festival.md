The Cambridge Female Composers Festival is a Cambridge-wide festival set up by students from across the university which will take place from January to March 2019. The festival aims to promote the study and performance of music by female and non-binary composers, as well as supporting the creation of music by women and non-binary individuals. We are running weekly recitals as well as a number of evensongs, and a gala concert on International Women's Day on the 8th March. Profits from our events will go to Cambridge Rape Crisis Centre. All information can be found at the website: www.cambridgefemalecomposers.com, or on our Facebook page at www.facebook.com/camfemcomposers.

The festival's opening concert is on Sunday 27th January at 8:30pm in Selwyn College Chapel, and features music by Lili Boulanger, Judith Weir, Cecilia McDowall, Judith Bingham and Hannah Kendall. Tickets cost Â£3 and are available from Selwyn plodge and on the door
