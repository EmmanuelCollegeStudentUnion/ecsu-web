In line with the proposal passed by ECSU in Lent 2018 the committee is urging finalists NOT to complete the NSS Survey. 

 + The survey contributes to the marketisation of Higher Education by propping up the TES framework, which could lead to a removal of the freeze on tuition fees.  

+ The boycott is effective. In 2016 (pre-boycott) 66% of finalists completed the survey, compared to only 18% last year. 

+ We need around 600 hundred students across the University to actively chose to boycott the survey for the results to be invalidated, and the committee hopes Emma students make up as large a proportion of this as possible.
