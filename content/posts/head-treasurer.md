Hi everyone, I’m Charlie, a third-year Geographer, and the ECSU treasurer until June 2017r. Together with Will, the Assistant Treasurer, I’m responsible for allocating funding form the college’s sports and societies account to Emma’s diverse set of societies and teams.

This year, myself and Will are keen to improve the transparency and communication involved in our roles. We aim to be available to offer up the rationale for our funding decisions upon request, and offer advice on future funding requests. We are also trying to make clearer the criteria on which we base our funding decisions, to make the process fairer. 

 I am also in charge of allocating the committee budget, which goes towards things like welfare events and sports days for college. I’m currently aiming to improve the accounting process of the account to help future treasurers.
