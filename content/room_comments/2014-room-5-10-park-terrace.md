The room is a little dark due to it being north facing. The view is alright though and it is a nice size.

The one annoying thing would be that there is a grad living above who has the whole floor and also posseses a washing machine. Regrattably this washing machine does tend to shake your whole room like a mini earthquake. Fun at first, annoying the more times it happens
