title: Room 13, Blantyre

I would definitely recommend this room. It's a good size and as others have said the storage space is plentiful. The bay window means lots of light and a great opportunity to people-watch, although it is easy to become distracted from work. Only a tiny bit of wall is shared with anybody, and there is an entirely pointless 1msquare entrance lobby (doubles as a changing room), which means noise levels are low. Probably one of the best rooms in Blantyre, even though others are higher grades. Only downsides are the distance to the showers and the lack of the sink, although the toilets are really close so the sink isn't really an issue. Blantyre is overall a great place to live, so definitely go for it if you can.
