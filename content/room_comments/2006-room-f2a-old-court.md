Nice set - probably the biggest one in the OC when you consider its got the biggest 'kitchen' area too - not as nice a table as some others though - but easily makes up for it by being ground floor so no annoying stairs - as for Room #1, well its got more light than #2, and although theres a little more noise from outside its far from unbearable. Overall, a pretty decent set - if you consider sharing a good thing (which you must if you're considering OC) then its easily the 2nd best set in the ballot, and runs F4 close for the title (although that does get abit more light and is pretty hefty itself.
