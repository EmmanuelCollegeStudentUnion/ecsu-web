title: Room 10, Blantyre
year: '2015'

Just to clarify this room has a full ensuite (shower, sink and toilet) and is therefore great value for money (I don't think there is a cheaper ensuite room). There is also an additional fridge table which I use as a coffee table. It has one of the new style, larger, square fridges which can be quite noisy but has a significantly larger capacity than the older ones. This room is quite small in comparison to other Blantyre grade 3 rooms but that's understandable given the ensuite and there's still enough room for most people. Though it is near a reasonably sized kitchen with hobs, it's also the kitchen used by the most people (Blantyre has 7 kitchens but this one is the nearest for 7 rooms) so it can get quite messy.
