I wouldn't entirely agree with 2008's comments- there definitely isn't any mould (I suspect it's been refurbished since 2008). It is very small, but it does have a sink and is right next to a shower, toilet and kitchen. It's also really near the common room which is great, but far enough away that the noise isn't a problem. I would say the only problems are the size (it really is very small) and possibly the fact that quite a lot of people have to use the same shower. Overall not a terrible place to be if you're low down on the ballot, like I was. Also, just a correction, there is now wired internet and CUDN access.
