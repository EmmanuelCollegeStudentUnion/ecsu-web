I love the room, really great size and colour scheme (yes, I do mean that).  I was really peasantly surprised by it when I first turned up.  Some downsides are the standard noise related ones - it's by the road and a drainage pipe in just by where you sleep.  The music rooms are also beneath but to be honest I like hearing the music and wold suggest if you don't like music let someone who can appreciate it take the room.
