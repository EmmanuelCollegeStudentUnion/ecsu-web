As a fresher, I was a bit apprehensive when I found out I had a grade 2 room on the top floor with no basin, but it's been a lovely room to live in. It's a decent size and the shape is a bit unusual, but isn't massively detrimental and creates a 'bedroom area' under the eaves which is quite nice. It is on the top floor which means lots of stairs, and people don't come up often so is probably nicer if you are in a group in 2nd or 3rd year, especially with freshers living on the lower floors. The gyp room is pretty small, but does its job and the toilets and sinks are right next door, which can be quite noisy at first, but it isn't a massive problem. Overall, it's a really nice room, and has more of a corridor feel because it is linked with both Q and R staircases.
