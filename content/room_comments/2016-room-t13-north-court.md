Really great room. Large, spacious, redecorated within the last year or two. The lighting is incredible and it's always really airy. It's next to the bathrooms which is convenient. There's no dresser but there are shelves and a mantlepiece. Spacious wardrobe. It looks over the bus stop, but the windows are double-glazed so the noise doesn't intrude at all and the view isn't particularly terrible. Overall it's a fantastic room and lovely to live in (and it's very sociable if you know the other people on your floor!)
