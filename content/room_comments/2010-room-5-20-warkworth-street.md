This is a lovely room, very big and with two windows that let a lot of sunlight in.  The walls and carpet are ok, but could do with revamping, and there isn't as much storage space as in a college room, but I haven't had any difficulties.  There are more chairs than will ever be needed and the heating works really well.  In the house there are two toilets, one shower and a bath with a shower attachment.  The kitchen on this side has a microwave combi oven and the kitchen under 19 has a hob.  Tesco Express has just opened at the back, so being out of college is not a problem.  Overall this has been a great room.
