This is an amazing room. It's definitely worth more than a grade 2, which I reckon was only given because it doesn't have a sink.

It has a marble fireplace, which is a great mantlepiece for pictures/ alcohol etc. Lots of storage - huge shelves, big chest of drawers, big closet. 

It's really big for a grade 2, there's enough space for me to fit 2 chairs and a coffee table in front of the fireplace. It's also right next to the kitchen, laundry, 2 toilets, and 2 showers (shared amongst 3-5 people, so you never ever have to wait.)

It's quite drafty sometimes because it's facing the road (also a privacy issue sometimes), but this also means there are huge bay windows which are nice when its sunny. Also just got the heating fixed, so its really warm in the winter!
