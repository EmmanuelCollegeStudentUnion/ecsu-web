Although I had my reservations before moving in, I have grown to love this room and Blantyre House in general. As mentioned before, really good value for a Grade 2, lots and lots of light, two wardrobes, 3 chairs and a big coffee table. Near enough to the common room to be sociable, but not so near that it's a nuisance. The walls ARE really thin (I have been woken up by my neighbour's alarm before) but this hasn't really been an issue for me. Don't buy in to all the Blantyre hate - I would definitely recommend this room!
