It's a very nice and good-sized room for a grade 3. It can be a bit dark because it is in the basement but you do have your own door which is quite useful. 

19 and 20 are connected through the basement so if you want to live out of college with a larger group of friends, this is the place. There is one gyp room and a kitchen both in the basement and shared between the 2 houses. They're both pretty rubbish but the kitchen does have hobs, a combi oven and a decent amount of space. 

Everything the person in 2009 said is still valid apart from the cat and the fact that 2009 is quite a long time ago now so calling the room recently decorated would be a lie. However everything is still in good condition and there are no chipped walls as is the case with some of the other rooms.

Overall a nice room to live in if you decide to live out of college. Close access to kitchen and bathrooms and a sink in the room.
