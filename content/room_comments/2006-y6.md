Nicely proportioned

Faces bus garagen (therefore quite noisey)

Double glazed

Newly painted (10/2005)

Green walls and carpet (carpet needs changing)

Shower/toilet next door

Gyp room down one flight of stairs

One radiator which never gets very hot

Furniture is old and unattractive

The only shelving is directly above the radiator, so this can damage book and other things you might want to put on them, such as plants or food

Distinct lack of drawers in the room

Nice curtains
