So the room is somewhat smaller than the ones below it and being on the top floor it does mean you have to walk to the basement to have a shower. and the toilets aren't the nicest ever. if that bothers you, but now for the positives:

-it has an awesome swing light set up in the bedroom. 

-In the living room there are endless furniture combination. Remember that game on old windows pc's? where you pushed those blocks around? yea, its like that, BUT REAL LIFE!
