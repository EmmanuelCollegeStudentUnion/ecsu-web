Nice and cosy, has lots of character with sloping attic walls. Hasn't been a problem for me but the attic probably isn't ideal for tall people. Really good size for a grade 1, loads of storage space. View onto the street, good for people-watching procrastination. No running water on this floor, but big kitchen and bathrooms on the floor below so it's not an issue. I love this room!
