It was quite cold at the end of Michaelmas but not so much in lent.

(I think the radiator needs regularly bleeding)

Also lots and lots of lady birds! (2-3 per day find their way in and need letting out!)

View of the paddock is still good, and not many people use the gyp room, compared with the other gyp rooms, because it is on the top floor.

There is no kettle or toaster resident in the gyp room - students have to provide their own (& share their own) in this gyp room!

Unlike J16 this room has two layers of windows (the closest to double glazing which seems to exist in College!) although the outside window is very drafty and rattly when it's windy!

Not too much shelving space but enough.

And a wonderful bedder!!
