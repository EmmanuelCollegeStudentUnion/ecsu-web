This room is in its own cosy little corridoor, but close enough to the common room to be a social space. Though small, it comes with a sink, a deceptively large wardrobe and three shelves. 

The soundproofing is not fantastic, but I was lucky with my neighbours. It is a nice working space and has a warm feel, a good choice for a grade 2.
