Great value for a grade 3, reasonably big, plenty of storage space and floor space, very nice big windows looking out over back garden so very bright and airy, very quiet as no noise from road and it's not directly over the common room, doesn't matter that there's no sink as there are 4 bathrooms just outside, two kitchens also nearby. One of the nicest rooms in the house, especially for its grade
