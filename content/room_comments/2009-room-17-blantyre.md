Not a huge room but fine for it's price, relatively warm but not boiling hot. Gets a reasonable amount of light, which has suited my plant nicely. 

You can hear everything that's happening in room 16. If you live here, make sure you are good friends with your neighbour and be considerate so you stay that way. The walls really are that thin, we have conversations through them.  Blantyre has many baths and three showers, which is a little bizzarre, but the kitchens are in general very good  and the co-op is quite handy.
