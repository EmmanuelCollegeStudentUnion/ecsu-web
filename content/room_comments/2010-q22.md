The room is not that small, but it is strange-shaped, so there isn't much storage space, but if you don't have too much stuff like I do, it should be ok anyway.

The light is not so good though but the heating is perfect!  

No basin, but the room is next to the toilet and sinks. A bath on the same floor but have to go down one floor for a shower.

There is a gyp room on the same floor, but with only a sink and a microwave, like most North Court gyp rooms.

Overall, considering that I was like 9th from the bottom of the ballot, this room is not that bad.
