2013-14. I now live in Q20a. Due to the fact that a lot of North Court has been renovated, this room is quite a basic one. The room itself is really sweet and looks lovely when clean and decorated. The wardrobe is quite spacious and there's a secret storage cubby behind the bed. The gyp room is tiny and quite derelict, and the three loos/showers of Q staircase are shared with R residents. If you don't mind any of these things (or the 4 flights of stairs) then it's a really sweet room to live in.
