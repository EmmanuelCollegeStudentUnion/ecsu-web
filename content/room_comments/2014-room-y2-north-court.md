As with the rest of X/Y/Z, recently refurbished so is nice and has plenty of plug sockets and has epos card-activated electricity, except for two sockets for fridge and computer. Faces the bus station, but the new double glazing means you get used to the noise quite easily. A tree blocks out pretty much all the light except in winter, so you need the light on all the time. No sink in the room, but right next to a shower and toilet, both with sinks, and the shower is lovely and powerful. Big gyp room upstairs for the whole staircase with hobs and sinks.
