Pretty standard New Court room, which doesn't really need selling in itself (REALLY nice rooms, ensuite, very central in college, etc. but no proper cooking facilities beyond the mini gyp room cupboard thing which has kettle, toaster and non-combi microwave - although there are ways of being creative, or hall is 20 seconds away) so I'll go with how it compares to other New Court rooms.

Since it's on the 2nd floor the ceilings are slightly lower, but since all the rooms are massive anyway that doesn't make a great deal of difference. Being in the top corner, this room doesn't get an awful lot of sun but you do get a good view over New Court and can see the top of chapel, which is nice. Also means you're above bus-level so don't have people looking into your bedroom at the back. Being on the corner nearest St. Andrews Street you do get occasional nighttime revelry noise, although it hasn't been that bad in my experience.

The bedroom has a slightly strange diagonal wall situation going on, but this actually makes it a tiny bit bigger than others in New Court, so not much to complain about.

Basically an extremely nice room, I've been very happy with it :)
