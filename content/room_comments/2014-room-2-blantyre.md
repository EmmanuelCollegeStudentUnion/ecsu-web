It's right on the main road so you never ever ever have any privacy and it's really really noisy; especially because it's right near the common room too. The windows are very drafty and it can get quite cold; but that's like all the old rooms in college.

Apart from that it's a great room - very big and light, lots of storage space, massive desk etc
