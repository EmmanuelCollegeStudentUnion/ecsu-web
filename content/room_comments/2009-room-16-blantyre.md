This is a cute room if you don't need much space (it's worth considering that with a common room downstairs anyway, you don't have to spend all your time in your own room). The fact that there's only one shower on this side of the house is not a problem, you don't have to go outside to get to the other side of the house and there are several showers there- it's a twenty second walk!  Can get a bit hot when the sun shines full in the windows. The main issue is the soundproofing- there is absolutely none, especially between 16 and 17.... think carefully about whether this might bother you...
