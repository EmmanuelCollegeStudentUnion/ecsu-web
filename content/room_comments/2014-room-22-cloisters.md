En-suite, as well as the functional kitchen, are the major advantages. The card reader saves energy and you get used to it fast; similarly, there is a persistent, inextinguishable beeping noise which you stop noticing after a week or two. The light isn't so great, and it's not huge (approx. the size of the South Court grade 3s), but the furnishing is near hotel-standard and the closet is actually surprisingly spacious.
