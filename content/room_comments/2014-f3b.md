Never mind the hype about the slopey floor. F3 has the potential to be the best or equal-best set in Old Court (at least until you see the Harvard Scholar's Room!) - along with the rest of the first floor. Positives are proper wood panelling, it's on the first floor so high ceilings and nice and light, good furniture with big table. You can also get away with murder in terms of the size of parties. Only downsides really are the usual Old Court floors and lack of bathroom. Highly recommended!
