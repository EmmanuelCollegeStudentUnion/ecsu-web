Resident 2013/2014 - Really nice room. Within the house it is close to the bathroom and, being on the second-floor, positioned nicely in between all of the rooms available to undergrads (therefore close to all your mates).

The room is a nice size with adequate storage and a nice view of the library and the paddock. For a Grade 4, this room is an absolute steal! Although you don't have a sink in your room, you are very close to a bathroom and two showers. There is also a toilet downstairs right next to the door for those pre-lecture poos. No road noise.

Park Terrace is a great house. Direct access to college and easy access to Parkers Piece. However, the kitchen facilities are not the best but you can still cook a lot of things.
