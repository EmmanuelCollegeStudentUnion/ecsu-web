title: Room J1a, Hostel
year: '2010'

Nicely decorated and has big windows with a view of the pond. No sink but near the toilet and gyp room. L-shaped so only part of the room can actually be used for socialising- which makes it feel quite small for a grade four. Very quiet (rooms at the back of hostel get a lot of noise from buses).
