New Lights! New Fridges! New Ovens! Same old Seymour the cat! The Blantyre attic is a great hideaway for you and three friends, as long as they’re not too tall… The closest bathroom and kitchen are just down a flight of stairs but it’s a bit of a trek to the closest shower. Great value in my opinion for a grade one if you can get over the sloped ceilings and extra flight of stairs.
