Quite a large room for a grade 4 but not much natural light despite three windows. Faces the bus station but suprisingly quiet unless the windows are open (it has secondary glazing), could be a problem though if you are a very light sleeper.

Overall a very good room (primarily due to size) for its grade, and one of the best available towards the bottom of the ballot (I got it at 28th from the bottom).

There is also a good kitchen in Z, with hobs and a selection of pots and pans as well as the microwave and toaster.
