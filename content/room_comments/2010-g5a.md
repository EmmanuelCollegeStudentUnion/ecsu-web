Lovely room, has the biggest bedrooms by far out of the Old Court sets, although the living room isn't quite as big by comparison (still massive though compared to anything else in college). The room looks like it's been redecorated recently, so the walls are actually nice without big flakes of paint missing. Lots of sunshine through the day, although it can be a bit noisy from Spoons on Fri and Sat. Ceilings are a bit thin too... but overall a really nice set, and the trek to the loos isn't that bad once you get used to it!
