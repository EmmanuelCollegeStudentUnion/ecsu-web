title: Room 20, Blantyre
year: '2012'

It's a lovely room. The main pro for this room is being in Blantyre. If you're low in the ballot this is an excellent room if you're desperate for Blantyre. The biggest con is the lack of running water in the attic. It's worth it for a low grade room in a lovely accommodation block though.
