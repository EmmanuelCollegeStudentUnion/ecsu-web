title: Room 17, East Court
year: '2016'

Pros – East court is great, Spacious, Modern, No noise from anyone above or beside you, large wardrobe and chest of drawers, toilet and kitchen next door to make up for lack of sink.

Cons – Poor view, probably not quite worth a grade 5, at the end of the building so you have to walk through doors.

I was ballot number 20 when I chose this room.
