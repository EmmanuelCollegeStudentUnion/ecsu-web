Really nice old court set in terms of bedrooms- quite big and nice furniture (although only one plug socket a bedroom). Living room is nice as well- and we have a really nice old, big table (rare in old court). Kitchen is fine, pretty small but no other problems. No light in the porch-y bit is a bit awkward sometimes.
