I love this room! It's grade 3, but it has just the right amount of space, it's been recently decorated and has its own front door! There is a toilet, shower and two kitchens (one of which has a hob and a dining table, shared with no. 19, which is great for having friends around) on the same floor (so it's a bit like a self-contained flat but even better!). 

There is also a cute cat which likes to visit from time to time (beware of letting it into your room though - it may refuse to leave!). Internet connection is wireless, which is pretty reliable on the whole - there have only been 2 occasions this year where it's gone a little haywire but it's always been sorted within a few hours. 

So on the whole, a really lovely room which I would greatly recommend!
