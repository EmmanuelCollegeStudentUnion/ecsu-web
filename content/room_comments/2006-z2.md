Surprisingly large room for a grade 2. No sink in room, but one right outside the door. Only problem is it is that the window opens out onto the pavement. This means that it can get quite noisy with all the traffic passing if you leave your windows open and it gets very dark if a bus stops outside. Still, I had a really great year in this room. Bargain!
