This is a lovely big room with three windows, so you get a lot of light.  It is on the corner of Z, looking over the bus station and Emmanuel Street, so it can get quite noisy at times, although after a few weeks you become immune to this.  The radiator can be quite noisy sometimes too, but this isn't too much of a problem.  There is a nice new carpet and some newish furniture and the walls are in a pretty good state.  The room doesn't have a sink, but there is one right outside the door, which is shared with Z11.  The gyp room is pretty good, with a microwave combi and a hob, and there are toilets on this floor.  The showers are downstairs and aren't the best but they are useable.  This has been a great room.
