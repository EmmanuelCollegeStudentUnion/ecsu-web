I have much of the same things to say as the comments below. Blantyre is a lovely place to live and has definitely helped me both work harder in the day as I stay in college and relax more in the evening. All of the attic gets a little hot sometimes so a small fan can be usefull. In addition it can be dark. The best light in the room by far is the desk lamp. If you bring a lamp and a fan though it is a truly great room. It's quiet enough to work when other people are having pres but also you can just go downstairs and find someone to talk to in the common room. I would thoroughly recommend taking all 4 attic rooms as a balloting group as it creates a lovely tiny community. You should probably be able to cycle so it doesn't even feel that far from college. It takes about 5 minutes to get to college and 12 to get to the sidgwick site. There are 2 shops nearby and both serve alcohol until 11 unlike little sainsbury's.
