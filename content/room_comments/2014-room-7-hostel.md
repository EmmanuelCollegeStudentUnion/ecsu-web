I agree with the comment already on the website, it is a really nice room - spacious, light and also really warm (even compared to other rooms in hostel) Hobs upstairs and downstairs (as well as the microwave on this floor), lots of storage space, very handy for laundry and music rooms, great for idly staring out of the window while working to see what's happening on the paddock...
