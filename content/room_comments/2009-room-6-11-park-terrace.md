Really nice room. House 11 has recently been re-painted so it's nice and fresh with a good kitchen (electric hob and mocrowave but no oven, could probably request a combi oven though) Nice big room with one window overlooking the garden and the paddock. Back facing window means less light in the mornings but much less noise than you get with the front facing windows.
