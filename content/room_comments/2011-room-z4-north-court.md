Temperature is good and controllable via a thermostat. The room stayed nice and warm through the winter despite the two outside walls. Lock system adds extra security and green-ness however it can be annoying if you have someone in your room and you can't take the card out since all the lights go out. Hobs and kitchen are really nice. Apart from lack of combination oven which I'm trying to sort out. Showers and toilets are brilliant with one between three people. Noise is ok. The bus station gives some noise but its never disturbed me since the soundproofing is very good. Finally it can be a bit out of the way socially surrounded by freshers, bbut subway is really convenient. It's a nice new room in a nice location.
