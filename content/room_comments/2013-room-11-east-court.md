title: Room 11, East Court

Great set of two rooms with a sink. A little bit annoying to have to go up a flight of stairs to go anywhere, whether it's to use a kitchen or visit your 'next-door' neighbour.

Road noise easily avoidable at night or for work by using the smaller room away from the road-side.

Ceilings higher than other basement rooms, and liveable in unless you are unusually tall.
