All the above comments are true, really nice room, lots of space (twice the size of a standard south court grade 3?) and the fireplace and bay windows are especially good to have. In a good part of the  house, right next to the bridge so can get to all of the showers easily (so finding a free one has never been an issue) as well as the common room and the laundry. Also right next to one of the better kitchens. Not having a sink isnt that much of an issue and the wireless connection (and wired) is great in this room. Not that much noise from the street as it isnt a busy road and you can see up both Gresham and Glisson roads from the desk (in the bay window) which is good if you like distractions, otherwise you might want to rearrange the room a bit. No directly neighbouring rooms (ie not sharing any walls) and can't seem to hear anything from above/below. Honestly cant think of any cons.
