Quite a nice room, as you'd expect from a grade 4; plenty big enough for everyone except the party hosts. It overlooks the road so you do hear buses and people go by, but it's not really a problem (except when they were using a pneumatic drill outside late at night) and is certainly better than the bus station. A sink would have been nice but, as the toilet and shower are just outside the door, it doesn't really matter.
