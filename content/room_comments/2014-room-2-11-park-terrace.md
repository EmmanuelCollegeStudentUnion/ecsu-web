This is one of the big ground floor Park Terrace rooms, easily bigger than the New Court living rooms and perhaps one of the biggest on college.

Pros: very big, a lot of storage space and you can normally leave possessions in rooms during vacations. Great for hosting. A great view.

Downsides: some noise from the road (buses stop not too late, but there's the occasional noisy car going by), rather rattly windows, and floor creaky in the middle. So don't go for this room if you're unable to work or sleep with quite a bit of noise going on. The current lighting can sometimes be a little dim-leave the main light on for a while before you're going to need it. People can sometimes see in, but there are shutters.

No sink, but there is a wireless port contrary to what is currently on the site (it took a while to find-it's on the very bottom slot of the middle bookshelf).

The house is bright inside, with oranges and reds.
