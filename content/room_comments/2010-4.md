Good: decent size (bedroom + living room), reasonably decorated and furnished (by college standards), hostel showers are reliably warm and queue-free, gyp room has a combi-oven (a rare luxury in third year accommodation) though have to go upstairs for a hob at present.

Bad: faces the road so can get noisy when windows are open, only one radiator which is in the living room, so bedroom can get cold, only one toilet on the staircase (there are plenty in the basement but they're not all that nice)

Definitely good value as a grade 5
