I would have described the room more as a lightning bolt shape than an "interesting L-shape". The room is really light and airy, with plenty of storage space. I've not experienced any problems with the radiator, the room is always warm. The shower is good and there is plenty of hot water, and I haven't had it block, though the flush on the toilets are a little dodgy I have found. All in all, a really nice room! I will say that there is a beep in NC which is odd at first, but within a week I'd stopped noticing it, and you can barely hear it in your room if the door is shut.
