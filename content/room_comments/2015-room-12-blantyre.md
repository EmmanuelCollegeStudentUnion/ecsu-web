Excellent room - bay windows provide a very nice view, with a lot of sunlight. Very big with a pretty fireplace and little sitting area next to the windows. Room can get a bit chilly, but it's not too bad. Close to several bathrooms [so the lack of a sink is not a problem at all] and right next to the bridge so close to good showers. Right next to a nice kitchen. Gets very little common room noise, but does get some level of road noise.
