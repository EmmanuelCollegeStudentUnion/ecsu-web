title: Room 32b, Blantyre
year: '2009'
---

This room is arguably the nicest in Blantyre. You have a shared lounge with 32a, with a quaint fireplace, coat cupboard, and huge windows.  There are currently two big fridges in the lounge.  The room itself is much larger than 32a, again with nice big windows.  Can be a bit noisy with the gate and people on the road, but it's a small price to pay!  Over on the quieter side of the house (i.e. the other side to the common room) so you don't get the noise from parties etc.
