This is a fantastic little room for its money. Prime location is very handy, and benefits from the inward facing window in terms of road noise. Massive wardrobe really is a benefit. Toilets and shower all in good working order. See all the other benefits in the previous comments.

Minor gripes are: 

- Single window means limited natural light during over the day 

- Can hear noise from hall and musical events in the Old Library (never been a problem though) 

- Can be relatively isolated if you don't know others in the 4 room flat

- Quite a lot of stairs on the way up (only an issue if suffering from mobility problems)

- Do get some tourists accidentally walking up the stairs (but there is a lockable door into the flat to prevent this.)

Despite these very small things, this is a brilliant room, particularly when avoiding the distractions that can come from a large staircase.
