I'm really enjoying living in this room this year! It is a very bright room as it is on the top floor. It has a built-in wardrobe which is very handy, as well as a big chest of drawers and a nice desk. It's such a good shape and size, and I enjoy being on the top floor. Th bathroom is very close, however the kitchen is in the basement, which involves 3 flights of stairs and lots of doors...

Overall, the house is fab and definitely one of the nicest Warkworth houses, with a nice modern bathroom and good wallpaper/flooring.
