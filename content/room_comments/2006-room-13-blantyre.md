title: Room 13, Blantyre
year: '2006'

N.B. I discovered on arrival that it isn't actually possible to see into the dance studio itself, but your lovely view down Gresham Road means a never-ending supply of leotard-clad totty walking down the street on their way to ballet.

The room is light, big and airy, though two exterior walls and said big bay window means it can sometimes get a bit chilly, especially given the tempramental nature of Blantyre's heating system. Masses of storage space with two wardrobes, one of which includes an ancient and interesting-looking book case (yet to be investigated). Walls and carpets in reasonable/grotty condition. It's also on the other side of the house from the housekeeper, meaning your illicit '+8 in a room shocka' gatherings stand a slightly higher chance of going undetected.

It's a good room and probably one of (if not the) best on this side of the house.
