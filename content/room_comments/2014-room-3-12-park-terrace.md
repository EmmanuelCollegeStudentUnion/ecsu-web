This is the back room on the ground floor of the house. Obviously it has less natural light than the rooms at the front, which look over Parkers Piece, but it's fine, and it's nice to have a view of the garden. Ceilings are really high so it feels very roomy. Good storage space, but no sink. 

The only real drawback with the house is that the kitchen is tiny - smaller than a South Court gyp room. It does have hobs, but no table like some other PT houses. This is because the whole second floor of the house has been converted into a fellow's flat, which also means there's only one bathroom (though with only four undergraduate rooms this isn't really a problem).
