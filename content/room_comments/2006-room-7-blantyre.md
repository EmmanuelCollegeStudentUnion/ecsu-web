Well, it's got a really nice view over the garden.  Apart from that, the rooms not great- v small- 3 paces wide by 5 long- so no room to swing a cat once bed, desk, wardrobe, fridge & sink thrown in.  

Luckily, you don't have to spend all your time in there- Blantyre's got a common dining room & a tv room (with a tv and evreything), as well as probably some of the best kitchen facilities you'll get- combi-oven and hobs.  So to stop claustrophobia setting in, get a group of you to live here & use the communal areas lots.

There's also a laundry and housekeeper thrown in- one very useful, the other needs to be handled with care.
