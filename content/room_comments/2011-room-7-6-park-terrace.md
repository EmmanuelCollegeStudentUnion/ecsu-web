title: Room 7, 6 Park Terrace
year: '2011'

There is no sink! The room is divided in two, which makes both bedroom and lounge feel incredibly small. (although you do gain a seperate bedroom which is cool). The only real pluses are the very large wardrobe and the view across Parker's Piece and the Paddock, albeit through windows the size of portholes. The nearest sink and loo are three floors below. Unless you enjoy isolation do not live up here; it is bloody awful!
