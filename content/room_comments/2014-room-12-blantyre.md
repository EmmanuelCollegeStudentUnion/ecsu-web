Very good sized room - higher grade than the equivalent nearby rooms (Grade 4 compared to grade 2), but much less noise from the common room (can barely hear it). In a very central part of the house, and near the kitchen and common room, but also close to the good showers. Room gets rather cold in winter due to the single glazing, so bring some extra blankets. Great view from the desk down Gresham Road, and lovely big windows for letting the light in. A very good room overall.
