Most importantly, DON'T be put off by the grade!! I absolutely adore this room, and I actually prefer it to my first year grade 6!!

It's small, but cosy rather than pokey, particularly because the hot water tank is (hidden) in the corner - lovely and warm. It is in the basement and doesn't get the sun, but I've never found it too dark, possibly because the whole house was repainted in summer 2012. It also has great storage space - currently 3 shelves, a chest of drawers and a wardrobe. It really doesn't matter that I don't have a sink because I'm the only one on the 2 lower levels, so I have sole use of the "communal sink" which is about 3 metres from my room. The shower is also only shared with a handful of people.

The house may not technically have a hob but everybody in 19 and 20 uses the hobs in 20 which are in the gyp room in the basement, so again, a few metres away. Currently, the gyp room in the basement of 19 has a combi oven anyway. In addition, 19 and 20 warkworth street have a back yard with our own bike racks, which is really important for security.

Finally, YOU ONLY HAVE TO PAY RENT FOR A GRADE 1!
