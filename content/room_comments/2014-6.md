The room is really spacious and warm, as it has double glazing and a large radiator, unlike others on the floor above which can get colder due to smaller radiators. The room faces the road, which isn't as nice as the view onto the paddock, but it isn't bad and you get enough light to survive! You have a sink which is super useful and the gyp room is super handy right next door. There's a sofa and 3 chairs in the room, so you definitely have enough space to host people. I'd definitely recommend it - it's a good size and in a great location!
