Rooms 3 and 5 are practically identical, with 3 on the first floor and 5 on the second (5 has a lower ceiling, so my room looks bigger).

I Agree with all the comments above, but I don't work in my room, so lack of daylight isn't really a problem - I don't think there's that much of a lack anyway!

3 is a very quiet house with only 4 undergrad rooms. This room is next to Dr Macfarlane's office, who is absolutely lovely, but it is also above the residence of another doctor who has been round to tell me to turn my music off. Not really a party room for this reason.

Good kitchen, but has only portable hobs and the world's worst microwave. You should ask the bursar to install a combi oven!

As a whole, the house is in great condition. Just remember though, you're in a house - doesn't quite have the same atmosphere as a staircase.
