This is a great room. It has two massive windows which face south and east over gardens, so you get a nice view and loads of natural light. The curtains are good at keeping it dark enough to sleep in in the mornings, though. The downside of the windows is that they are single glazed, and it can get quite cold in winter if it's a grey day - bring a hot water bottle and obtain an extra blanket!

The room is an interesting shape, which makes it seem more personal. I really like the layout, and you can move stuff around if you want. Large built in wardrobe with ample space - I converted half of mine into a pantry instead. Nice decoration, and close to a good sized kitchen with two hob rings and two microwaves in it (apparently we're not allowed a combi oven though). Furniture includes bed, desk, desk chair, comfy chair, chest of drawers, fridge on table, coffee table and built in wardrobe. There is a bathroom and shower/toilet room on the same floor which is handy, but there are two more showers downstairs which have much better water pressure. Laundry room also downstairs with a washing machine and dryer, although the dryer doesn't usually dry your clothes all the way. Next to the laundry room there's another kitchen which has a combi oven, which I've used a couple of times.

I was warned that this room had the reputation of being the 'spider room', but I haven't seen any so far this year. I put conkers on the windowsills because apparently that discourages spiders. If you do get spiders, I heartily recommend this method. One last tip - this room is a favourite ladybird-hibernating location. If you open the windows during Michaelmas term, hordes of ladybirds will take up residence in the corners of your room over the winter. I personally didn't mind, but they tended to start dying all over the floor come January.

Overall a really good room, with great value for money. It's a less than 5 minute cycle to college, so it's easy to go in for stuff. I didn't tend to use hall very much because the kitchen let me cook for myself and my friends much more than I could last year.
