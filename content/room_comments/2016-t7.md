Large room looking onto the bus station so can be noisy/ have headlights shining through the window.  A large wall of windows with the bottom ones dimpled for privacy.  The radiator manages to heat the room.  Built in wardrobe with out-of-term storage cupboard above.  Slightly soulless but that is solvable!
