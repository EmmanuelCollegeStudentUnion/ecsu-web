Really lovely room! It's not particularly small (especially considering it's a grade 1!) and the sloping ceiling isn't too much of an issue. Could possibly be a problem for tall people, I'm 5 foot 7 and it's been fine for me, but if you're taller than that might be worth checking it out for yourself. It looks out onto the street, which means that sometimes it's a bit loud at night but as it's a residential area it's not too bad. Also Blantyre itself is a great place to live so definitely consider it!
