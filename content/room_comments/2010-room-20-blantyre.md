Whilst this room is quite small, it's bizarre L-shape means there's actually quite a lot of space to store all your things, especially with a large chest of drawers and a fitted wardrobe.

You have to go downstairs for kitchens, showers and toilets, which might be a consideration for some (though i have no problem with it)

The ceilings slope, and though I do have to duck my head occasionally (I am 6'4") I have only actually hit my head a few times.

Major pros of this room are, firstly, its in Blantyre House, which can become a really good community if lots of friends fill out the rooms (the common room is a major plus). Also, it's South facing which means its never too cold, and it's really cool being in the four attic rooms if you fill them out with your ballot group...

All in all, I way prefer this to my Grade 5 South Court room of last year, but it's one you should definitely come and have a look at and see if you'd get on with it...
