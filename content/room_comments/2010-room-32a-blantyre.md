Really good set of rooms. Bedroom for 32A is quite small, but not horrifically so given the presence of a good sized lounge. Was chilly over winter, but that seems to have been a problem with the central heating that is now fixed. New hot plate in kitchen is great, and there are microwaves and combi-ovens aplenty. Whole house is lovely and clean - especially the bathrooms, even a bath worth using!
