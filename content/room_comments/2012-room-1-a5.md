I currently live in A51. The room is a good size for its current grade (3). The proximity to hall is fantastic - no excuses for missing meals, and it's perfectly central within college for visiting n/s court and hostel.

The main downside is the noise. At the weekend you need to be a heavy sleeper as Revs and Spoons are within view of the window and it can get very noisy. And during the day you'll need to get used to the regular 2 minute beeping from the crossing. There are outer and inner windows, but at the moment both don't quite shut properly, so the noise is not as muted as it could be.

But if you don't mind the noise (and like me can sleep through anything) then it's a lovely room - high ceilings and sink. And 2 toilets and 1 shower between the four rooms. And one last thing, the shower is not hot. It is at best lukewarm, and there's nothing maintenance can do, so if that's of great importance I would look elsewhere!
