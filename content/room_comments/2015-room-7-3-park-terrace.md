Really nice room with views into college and out onto Parker's Piece- about averagely sized. On the 3rd floor- so quite a few stairs and the ceiling is quite low and sloped- so it probably is not best for someone who is really tall (although I'm 5'10" and its fine for me). There isn't a sink in the room- but there is a toilet and two showers between the 1st and 2nd floor. The kitchen is between the ground and 1st floor. It's probably about average for college kitchens- but is still quite small- (It doesn't have room for seating). There is a fellow on the ground floor and a fellow's office on the 1st floor, but they are both really friendly and as they are a few floors below you don't really notice them being here unless you bump into them when coming or going.
