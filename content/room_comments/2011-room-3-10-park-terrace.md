NO BASIN. But does have a wired connection. Medium-Large room, high ceiling, big window looking out onto the garden. Only 4-5 hours of direct sunlight though. Very little noise pollution (no damn buses!)Lots of (high) shelves but small wardrobe. Toilet just round the corner and gyp room and shower up half a floor. No nasty draughts - ie. stays warm.

Gyp room only has a microwave but is nice and clean and a good size (as far as gyp rooms go).All in all, I liked living here. The lack of a basin isnt so bad with nearby gyp room and bathroom (there are no stupid intermediary doors in the hallways like in most of college). Though it is a quiet part of college - you're not going to run into many people who aren't house mates.
