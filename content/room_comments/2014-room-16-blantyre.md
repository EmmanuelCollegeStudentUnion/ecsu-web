Blantyre 16 is a nice, small and cozy room. It has fantastic lighting and receives a lot of sunshine during the day. It had a fantastic large wardrobe for a grade 1/2,a sink with sizable cupboard underneath, clean carpets and lots of shelf space. It also has double glazed windows which keep outside noise out and inside heat in.

The negatives are that there is a shower underneath and with the sun shining in, the room is always warm. I have never had to turn the heating on, even in midwinter. Also a some sound can be heard from two rooms next door, but only if its extremely loud. Normal conversations can't really be heard!
