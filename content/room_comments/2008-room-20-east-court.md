Pos: Good sized room. Has a sink and 2 windows (can get a good draught going when it's warm out). Has an awesome view if you're a nosey type...

Neg: Next to park street. Traffic noise might annoy some people. The floors are really thin, so make sure you know the person in #18 (ditto for 17 and 19)
