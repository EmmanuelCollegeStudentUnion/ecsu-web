Not bad, quite a lot of floor space but the sloping roofs are rubbish if you are tall. Also very dark, the window is very small and gets no direct sunlight. No sink either which is a pain, quite far from toilets/showers though the shower in the stable block is quite nice. Reasonable amounts of noise from the street but you do get used to it.Go for this room if you are a short, deaf vampire
