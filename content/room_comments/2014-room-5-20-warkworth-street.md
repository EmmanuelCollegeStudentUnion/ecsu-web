This is such a nice room! The house has been recently refurbished, the toilet and shower are just across the landing, the gyp room in the basement has a microwave and combi oven, and the kitchen next-door has 2 hobs, a combi oven, a table and chairs. The heating works well, the windows let in lots of light, the room is massive and it's close to college. I've had no problems here, and would really recommend it. Only downside would maybe be the cooking facilities - 2 hobs between everyone in 19 and 20 is not much, but that's really the only problem with living here!
