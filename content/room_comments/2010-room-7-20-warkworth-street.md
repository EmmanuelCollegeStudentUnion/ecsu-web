Room is a good size and well laid out. Plenty of light as on 2nd floor. Faces road, which is not too busy, but occasionally noisy with police station.

Large communal kitchen is great, but being on 2nd floor means it's a bit of a treck to the kitchens and shower. However toilet and bath on next floor down.
