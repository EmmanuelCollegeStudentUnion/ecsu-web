I've really enjoyed my room this year. There's nice furniture, coffee table, chair, chest of drawers, shelves and a reasonably-sized wardrobe, although it did all need moving around at the beginning, but no bedside table. It's quite a large room and being on the top floor means it gets lots of light (the curtains aren't great and lights gets in in the mornings). Walls are quite thin but not a huge issue.

Not in close proximity to a gyp room, there's one in the basement of Warkworth 20. Our basement is connected through to the basement of Warkworth 19 and so we share a communal kitchen, which is nice particularly if they're your friends. Bathroom one level down is nice and new.

Living in a house has been a lot of fun, don't find the walk to college all that bothering. Except when doing laundry.
