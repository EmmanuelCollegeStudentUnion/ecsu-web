Small indeed. And can be noisy with the traffic outside as the window opens onto Parker Street near the bus station. There is quite a big wardrobe and a chest of drawers, a decent size desk and loves of shelves above the desk. There is also a mini fridge, as usual, and a large notice board. If you have a choice between J5b and J4b, go for J4b - it's got a larger window and the set up is a bit better. J4b doesn't have a chest of drawers but does have a handy bedside table.
