H4 is a lovely room, very big and comfortable - having two rooms is amazing. It can be quite loud from the road but no worse than living on any busy road. It's reasonably good value though being such a nice room it means you have to move your stuff out in the holidays more strictly than in other rooms.

For some reason the internet is pretty terrible, and having hobs on all floors except this one is quite weird, but neither of these are huge problems.
