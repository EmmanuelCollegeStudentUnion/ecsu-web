The best old court room in my opinion. Not very slopey, will be right by the showers and toilets when they're installed next year (however there might be extra noise from that, you might want to check that). Very central in college and perfect for having friends round. Very little noise apart from when people are coming out the bar. Very large bedrooms and no flakey paint. Bring plenty of posters and lamps and lots of extension cords as no old court rooms have enough plug sockets.
