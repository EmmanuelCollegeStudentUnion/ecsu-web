Great, cute room, which contrary to college knowledge DOES have a sink - yay.  Perks include a full-length mirror and a pantry cupboard, road isn't too noisy and although the paddock-facing rooms on this corridor are much sunnier, this room is more spacious than the others, packed with compact storage spaces and a bargain at Grade 3.  Recommended!
