This room is clearly destined for those wallowing at the bottom of the ballot. It's tiny, has one less chair than the other rooms of what is indisputably the worst corridor of the house, and due to the wall-facing window natural light is rather limited. To continue the mould motif, there is none; however, they refurbed it last year and the new carpet has that sort of industrial chemical smell to it which isn't great. 

Advantages are that it's very near the toilet, stairs leading to the upper part of the house, shower (shared by far too many people due to uneven shower distribution in the house), kitchen and common room. Having said that, the walls are paper thin so pray you don't have a promiscuous neighbour: I once heard a phone go off next door and it was on vibrate.

In conclusion, avoid this cave of a room if you can.
