Phenomenal room. Marble fire place, large well lit desk next to bay window. Ample wall space, windows open wide enough to hop out into garden. Comes with cat - name Seymour. Leave your window open and he will come in, buy him cat treats and he will be your friend (he likes Dreamies, £1 in Sains). Also comes with fancy rug (see pics).

Toilet ~2m from room, rarely in use. Two showers ~5m from room, never both in use (essentially only shared with 23 & 24). Large gyp ~ 10m from room, washing machine ~8m from. Good storage, comes with two small tables, 3 chairs and a desk chair. Ample shelving. No sink. Nice high ceiling, sufficiently warm in winter. 

Down sides: Next to house keeper but I've never had an issue, two doors so don't forget to lock both if you care about security (tough life eh), grade 6 is a pain but I think worth it.
