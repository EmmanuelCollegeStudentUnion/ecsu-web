Okay, so it doesn't have a sink or a bathroom in the same floor but that didn't really matter. The room is cosy- if you've get a good group of friends in these 4 rooms it's a great place to escape to after a busy day of work. Yeah the ceiling is low, a problem if you're tall like me and the room is quite dark- so invest in a few extra lamps :) The wardrobe space is good- plus living in Blantyre is such a nice atmosphere
