Really great room, facing away from college (not over paddock). Just like most of the other hostel rooms, really big with seperate bedroom and sink. Not too noisy with buses going past as there is good double glazing. Showers in the hostel are smelly but amazingly powerful (if down four flights of stairs...) Only negative thing is this room never gets any sun straight through the window. Cooking facilities are great, hob between four on my floor, combi-oven to share between staircase, etc..
