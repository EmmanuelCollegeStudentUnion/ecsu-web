Quite a big room on the first floor with a large bay window overlooking Gresham Road. There is no sink in the room but there are about 6 bathrooms/toilets close by. The gyp room next door has a hob (at the moment) and a microwave. Room 11 is opposite although there are no other rooms adjacent so I suppose it's in quite a quiet area of the house.
