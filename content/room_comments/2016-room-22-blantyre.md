Huge room. Stunning bay window. Formerly the dining room of the house, complete with decorative door. Surprisingly very warm in Winter for such a big room (three radiators!). Best thing about the room is it's location. It has two doors, one leading onto the corridor, the other leads into the area with a kitchen, two showers, two toilets and the washing machine room. It's like a mini-flat. Good internet. 

Palatial room. Good location in house. Stunning bay window with desk, and high ceiling.
