title: Room 20, Blantyre
year: '2006'
---

Attic room. Small with sloping ceilings, so maybe avoid if taller then about 6 foot. Otherwise fine, newly decorated, quiet, nice view. Gets a bit too warm sometimes.

Blantyre is an awesome house. It's all been newly decorated, theres a common room, good kitchens with hobs and a laundry.
