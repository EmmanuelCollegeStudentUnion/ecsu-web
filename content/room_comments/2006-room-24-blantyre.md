Good size for a grade 1 room. Ground floor with large windows into the street.The trees and bushes planted in front of the window give a fair amount of privacy, but don't block out too much light. Very close to laundry, 2 showers, toilet and kitchen. Blantyre has a common room, which is on the other side of the house from this room, which means you always have a shelter from the ongoing parties in commong room!

negative points-it's close to the main gate which is quiet noisy. Other than that, it's a great room, and definetly recomended!
