This room is a good size for a grdae 3. The staircase has 4 rooms, a very very very small gyp room and 2 toilets and a shower.

It's a great room and very convenient for hall and he plodge. 

This room is the only room that doesn't look onto John Lewis and looks onto New Court instead. This makes it a lot quieter!

This rooms main advantage is it's HUGE WARDROBE! The best selling feature for sure!
