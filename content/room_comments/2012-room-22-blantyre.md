title: Room 22, Blantyre
year: '2012'
---

A lovely big room on the right-hand side of the house, that has a large bay window looking out over the garden, so it is very light, especially in the morning. Blantyre is now connected to the University data network (as of January 2012), and although people in the other side of the house seem to have problems with it, I haven't in this room, which means data speeds are fast, and comparable to rooms in college. There is a fairly big kitchen that is shared between rooms 22, 23 and 24, and has two hobs and a microwave. The room is next to the housekeeper, which is fine (except if you don't like hearing dogs barking late at night). There's less storage space than some of the smaller rooms in Blantyre (i.e. room 23), but it's fine because the room is so huge.
