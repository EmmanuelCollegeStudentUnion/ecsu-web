Small but cosy. Double-glazed window - big plus. Sink. Only one shower on this side of the house. Recently painted and carpeted. Decent sized wardrobe with shelves in. No chest of drawers. Nice and bright (when sunny). Can hear loud conversations through the wall but noise generally is not a problem. V tasteful curtains (considering college norms)
