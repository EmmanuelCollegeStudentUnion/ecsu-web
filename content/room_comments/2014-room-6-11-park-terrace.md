Great room. When you enter, there is lots of open floor space so the room feels very spacious. There is one huge window with a beautiful view of the Paddock and the Park Terrace gardens. The room is so high above normal sightlines that you remove the drapes and maintain privacy. It comes with nice wooden furniture of classic 60s/70s style. While there is plenty of shelving, there is very little hanger space.
