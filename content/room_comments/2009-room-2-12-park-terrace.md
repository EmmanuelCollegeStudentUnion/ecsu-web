Grade 6, nice large room (biggest in the house), ground floor. Two windows facing out onto Parkers Piece so lovely and light in the mornings. No sink unfortunately but two toilets/sinks in the house. Bathroom has shower but no bath. Very small kitchen area with microwave but you're not allowed a hob (checked with the bursar again this year and he said no).
