Now a Grade 5 - highly recommended. 

Inward facing - no bus noise, lots of nice sunlight in the morning.

Recently refurbished - curtains are not green anymore, thankfully.

Lots of storage space: chest of drawers, cupboards, and shelves.

Furniture is new.

Double doors are handy for isolating yourself (and your neighbour) in from potential staircase noise if you need an early night (rower). 

Kitchen is just across the landing - well equiped with four hobs. No combi oven though unfortunately!

Nicest room in Y staircase I would say - Y5 is the mirror image of it. 

Only problem is an occasionally noisy rumbling fridge. You get used to it though.
