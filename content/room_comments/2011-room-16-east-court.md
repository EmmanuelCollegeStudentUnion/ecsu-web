This room is great! For a Grade 4, you get a lot for your money. It's a good size, clean, nice carpet, sink and large wardrobe both in built-in cupboards. My favourite part is the window seat which looks out on a pretty little garden in a little-known part of college. Only real downside is that it can feel a bit isolated, so I'd recommend having friends in rooms 18, 19
