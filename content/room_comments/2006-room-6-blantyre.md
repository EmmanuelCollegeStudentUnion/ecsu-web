title: Room 6, Blantyre
year: '2006'
---

Rooms 4,5,6,7,8 are all identical and really, really small. If you're a poor sod at the bottom of the ballot like I was, choose 6,7,8 over 4,5 because they're nice and sunny and look out into the garden.

Blantyre negatives: mainly small rooms, not in college, absolutely insane housekeeper.

Blantyre positives: really great dining room and tv room area (great for dinner parties), combi ovens and hobs, laundry on site, not as far from the world as Barnwell, next to the gym and a supermarket, kebab shop, Domino's, noodle place...

Basically, Blantyre's not great, but like everything, it's what you make of it. A group of ten of us all ended up here together and had a really fun time. So: don't make Blantyre your first choice, but don't kill yourself if you're forced to live here either... Drag your friends down with you.
