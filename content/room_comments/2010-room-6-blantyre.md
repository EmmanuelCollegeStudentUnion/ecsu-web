title: Room 6, Blantyre
year: '2010'

Small room, as mentioned above, other than that can't complain, its got a sink and a nice view of the garden. Blantyre as a whole is a great place to live if you get a good group of people in there, with a common room (with TV), big dining room, and a growing collection of shopping trolleys.
