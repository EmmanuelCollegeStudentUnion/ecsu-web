Good size, larger than most of the grade 2s in Blantyre. As mentioned, two decent sized windows provide plenty of light. Never had any problems with noise, though the walls are quite thin so would depend somewhat on your neighbour. Plenty of storage space with two wardrobes, two overhead cupboards, and a cupboard under the sink. I haven't had any of the problems with the sink the person below mentions so this has probably been sorted; water is fine for drinking and temperature is fine if you let them run for a minute.
