Really great room - absolutely huge and lots of natural light. Lots of shelving, a couple of chairs and a sofa. The main bathroom is just across the hall. House has been refurbished so nice carpets and relatively recently painted walls. The kitchen facilities are the only downside as this house only has a tiny galley kitchen with no hob (only combi oven) but the house next door is connected and has hobs. The house has two loos and two showers.
