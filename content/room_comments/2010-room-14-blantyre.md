One of the nicest rooms in the house, with a nice tree/neighbour's lush garden/widescreen TV outside for a view. Decent size given grade, and huge wardrobe/loads of shelf space. Has a weird mini-lobby which usefully blocks most noise from the stairs, so you can choose how sociable you want to be. The tree is really nice.
