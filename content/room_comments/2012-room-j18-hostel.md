Lovely view of the paddock.

Seperation between bedroom and living room.

Sloping ceilings make this room smaller than the ones on the floor below. Windows are smaller too.

4 flights of stairs to the showers!

Can get cold, but I think this might be sorted by next year.

Gyp room with hobs on the same floor. Toilet on floor below.

No noise from water pipes, fridge, buses :)
