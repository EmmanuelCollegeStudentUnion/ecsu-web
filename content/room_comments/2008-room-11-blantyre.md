Nice room - really big for a grade 2. Big South facing bay window, so plenty of natural light - you may want to bring an extra lamp, as the main light isnt the brightest.  Bathroom and nice kitchen just around the corner. this room is above the common room, so if you're really noise sensitive, you may not want it.  In practice, the common room isnt used much / loudly.  Very good for the price
