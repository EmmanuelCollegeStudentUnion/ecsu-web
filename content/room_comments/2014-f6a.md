Bedrooms are well sized, and lack the slopes that blight a few other sets. Furniture in bedroom is decent - though wardrobe is a bit small/old. In main set the big oak(?) table is a highlight, the slightly dirty sofa not so good. Plenty of chairs otherwise, and nice fireplace. A bit annoying having to go through two doors to get into the set. Kitchen small but fine, same as any other in OC. Good views from all windows, no massive trees in the way like some others.
