Largely agree with the above. It is small, but it has never bothered me and doesn't feel cramped. Has a sink, a nice big wardrobe, standard desk, shelves above desk (handy), standard bed, pin board, plenty of storage space - I can't really think of anything that's lacking. Toilet and shower are literally about 6 seconds walk away, kitchen is about 8 seconds and common room is about 10 seconds. The good thing about Blantyre is that most social stuff occurs in the common room, so you won't need a big room for entertaining guests. Not sure why
