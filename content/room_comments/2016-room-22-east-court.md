Can't hear much noise from the road as the room is on the college side of east court.

Can see a bit of Parker's piece out the window.

Window seat with radiator underneath is nice for sitting and reading in.

No basin is not a problem.

Modern kitchen with Hobbs though they are a bit slow to heat up.

Modern room, nicely decorated.

Good size desk, shelves near desk.

Large closet with shelves. 

Little round coffee table :)
