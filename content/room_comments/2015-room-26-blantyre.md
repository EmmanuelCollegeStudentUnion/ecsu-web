This is a lovely room! I haven't found a problem with noise (except for use of the shower in the mornings) as the windows can be locked so that they don't rattle. The heating is fine - I find it almost too warm with the radiator at times so turn it down! It has a lovely fireplace and 2 chairs (one being a desk chair). The layout of the room is really nice and usable. Can be a bit isolated if you don't keep the door open (as your neighbours are the toilets) but if you have friends living around you then it is really nice! There are lovely views outside and the window opens very wide which is lovely! A genuinely lovely room that I would recommend to anyone!
