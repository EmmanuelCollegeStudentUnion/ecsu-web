title: Room 11, Blantyre
year: '2006'
---

A great value room that I really love and would recommend choosing. 

The view is not that bad (you can just about see some of Blantyre's back garden and spy on people as they go to get their bikes from the bike shed). South east facing so plenty of light especially in the mornings although the curtains are dark enough for sleeping in. 

Furniture includes a bed, cupboard, desk, fridge on table, chest of drawers and two chairs. Pale green walls (painted this year) and blue/green carpet. Picture rail useful for hanging posters etc. 

During the day the room is very quiet although it can get quite noisy if there are a lot of people / loud music in the common room which is below.

Blantyre in general is a fantastic place to live with plenty of bathrooms, kitchens, a common room / TV room, friendly housekeeper and only a 10 minute walk from college.
