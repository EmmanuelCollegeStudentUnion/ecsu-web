Really nice room - the smallest of all the front court rooms, but still a decent size, and nice and bright, with quite a lot of storage space.

The radiator is now working (although it takes quite a lot of effort to turn on and off), as is the shower.

Kitchen is tiny, and lacks hobs, but unless you're planning on cooking something much fancier than a ready meal, this really isn't an issue given how close Hall/Sainsbury's/the vending machine are.

The window faces onto revs, so you do get quite a lot of noise in the evenings - the outside/inside window combo helps a bit, so it's not too bad, but it does help to be a fairly heavy sleeper.

Best features of the room are its location, nice layout if you know the other three people you're living with, and best shower/toilet to person ratio in college.
