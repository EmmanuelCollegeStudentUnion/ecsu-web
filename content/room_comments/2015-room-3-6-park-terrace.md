title: Room 3, 6 Park Terrace
year: '2015'

This room has very high ceilings, so requires a lot of decorating. Great view out into the back garden and huge window keeps it bright in the day. However, the lighting is poor in the evening so additional lamps are needed. The room is very quiet (you can't hear any buses, etc).

The kitchen is lacklustre. It has a good microwave but a very average double hotplate - they don't get hot at all. 

This room is currently a grade 4, compared to an almost identical room above (PT 6 room 4) which is a grade 5.
