the old comments are pretty accurate. is a pretty big room for a grade 3, its well set out with tons of storage space. the carpets fine and the bathrooms are really close by. the showers however are a little further away either downstairs in the back of the house or across the bridge in the other house.

would say the street noise isn't too bad and there is hardly any at night. though you can easily hear the bass from peoples music from downstairs and people stomping around upstairs - but you'd probably get that in any accomodation.

all in all a jolly nice room i thought.
