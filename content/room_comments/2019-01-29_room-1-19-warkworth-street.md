I really adore this room. The big bay window means it's light and it feels really spacious. The room layout (including small sofa and chair) is fab for socialising. Having a sink is a bonus as well as being on the same floor as the toilet. Being at the front of the house can mean it's noisy as you can hear everyone going in/out but does also make the room sociable as people often pop in on their way to their room. One of the taps is very stiff and hard to turn off and there's a rather ominous crack in the wall...but apart from that this room has served me very well and really feels like a home!
