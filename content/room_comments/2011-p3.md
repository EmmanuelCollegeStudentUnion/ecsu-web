Very spacious, and in good condition,Kitchen area off bedroom with microwave, toaster, fridge and sink.Ensuite bathroom is good, shower reasonably powerful, always seems to be plenty of hot water.Bedroom window looks out on Drummer street (toward savino's etc), fairly soundproof, though can be a bit noisy if lots of people moving through town at night.Heating is great, controls on all radiators (one in each room) which give out more than enough heat, even in the depths of winter.
