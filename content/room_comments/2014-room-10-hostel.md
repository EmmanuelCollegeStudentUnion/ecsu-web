Has been a great room so far!

It's the room facing to the back of college - and though this is a massive setback for some people, the view around the back of Emma is actually quite nice. It almost feels like you're not actually in Cambridge! In the summer it'll be a great view!

Like past comments, the following things might be annoying or inconvenient:

The radiator is only in one room, so it can get quite cold in the bedroom.

Because the room is north-facing, there isn't so much light (which might be a good thing for some people!) But it does mean that you won't get blinded from floods of sun!

The staircase toilet is on the ground floor, and the showers are in the basement.

The kitchen is so-so. There is a working hob. But if you're planning to cook a dinner for twelve, it ain't happening...

Good points:

It's still a nice room. You will need some extra furniture (like your own pieces from home, lamps, etc.) to fill up the space.

The wireless router is in the room! (So great WiFi!)

The kitchen is on the same floor. There is a combi-oven on the floor below. You'll get the view of the Paddock from the kitchen, and the view of the houses on the back.

Being on the top means that you do have a bit more privacy.

Laundry...(need I say more?)

I highly recommend this room!
