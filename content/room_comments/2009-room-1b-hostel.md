Very good size for Grade 2 but is constantly quite warm for some unknown reason. Lots of furniture/storage. Next to Gyp Room (with microwave-oven and hob), 5m from toilet and above showers/baths and laundry. Boring view of road which can sometimes be a bit noisy at night becuase of sirens. Very friendly bedder!
