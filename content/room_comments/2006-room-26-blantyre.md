Lovely big room, with a sink (big plus), a fireplace (not useable, unfortunately) and a mantlepiece. Recarpeted and painted at Christmas. Lots of shelves and storage space. High ceilings. Can be very cold in winter - just work out how to use the radiator. Not double-glazed: the windows rattle when it's windy, but not a big deal because it faces onto the back garden.

Beside two bathrooms and a kitchen - can be a little noisy but also never a big deal - and quick access to the facilities.
