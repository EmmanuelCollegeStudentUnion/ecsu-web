Fantastic room - loads of space for very little money, and the two huge windows make it feel even bigger. Plenty of sunlight which makes it a really nice place to work, especially in the evenings when lovely sunset colours come in through the smaller window. Loads of storage space except for the fridge, which can only fit about one meal's worth of food in - but with Tesco just down the road this isn't really a problem. Its also right next to the biggest kitchen in the house, and as I'm a rugby player I definitely appreciated having baths and a washing machine in the house. The showers are also far better than they were in my old room - good water pressure, even if lots of people using the water at once.

Two points to bear in mind - the room is quite hard to heat in the winter, as it is single glazed with two external walls, so loses heat very quickly overnight but sunlight coming in through the windows heats it up a lot in the day. Basically it will be warm in the day time, then plummet overnight so it is cold in the mornings. The second point is that as mentioned above, the room does have its own ecosystem. Opening the windows in Michaelmas leads to an invasion of ladybirds from the colony outside, which seemed to survive pretty well for most of the term then started dying out in the last few weeks. This corrosponded with a number of large, well-fed looking spiders appearing. We are on freindly terms and they have been keeping me company throughout Lent term, but if you are not happy to offer lodgings to such guests this may not be the room for you.

But overall: cheap, loads of space, lots of light, big kitchen, washing machine, baths and really not as far away as people think. Also super convenient if you are in the chemistry department a lot.
