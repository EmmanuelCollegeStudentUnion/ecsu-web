The room which is staying as a grade 4 after the re - grading is really good value for money. There is lots of storage space, plenty of light (massive windows) and is really close to showers/toilets/the biggest kitchen in the house. People tend to socialise in the common room so getting a big room to have people over isn't really necessary. However, if you want the space, it would be a really good room to go for.
