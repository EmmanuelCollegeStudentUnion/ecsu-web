Nice little room overlooking the paddock.  Good storage (big wardrobe and drawers), good heating, no sink but right opposite the toilet and kitchen.  Potential problems are: the wall with 1a is thin, which would be an issue if you had a noisy neighbour, and the light on the outside is by the window, making the room a bit light at night
