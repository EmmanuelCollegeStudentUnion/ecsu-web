This is a really great room, I love it! I would second everything said in the 2010 comment, and add that it's also nice and big. Currently it's only a grade 3, and you get so much for it - I reckon if it were in college it would be a grade 5 or 6.

I would say the best thing about this room is the French doors - they let in a lot of light, they can let in/out air, they allow easy access to the bike sheds (particularly good in the morning lecture rush!), you can catch friends on their way in/out of the house (a good thing for me but probably not so good for them!), and they mean that if you lose your college card (which you need to get in through the front door to the whole house) you can still use your key to get into your room through the back (providing you haven't lost your key as well!). This last point is also good if you've got a friend staying who you have to split up with for some reason - one of you can take the key and the other the card, and both can access the room providing the front room door is left unlocked.

Another thing to add is that it's got a really good radiator and the windows have a twisty lock (lots of the others in the house are the ones that you lift) so I haven't had a problem with being cold, and the windows don't rattle.

I've found the main disadvantages to be the tiny kitchen and the almost-useless shower (it's more of a drizzle) - but my kind friends on the other side of the house let me use their kitchen and I always use the other showers (these are better than my shower at home!), so it's not too much of a problem :)

Also the distance from college is a bit inconvenient, but on the whole I really don't mind it - it feels more relaxing because it's a bit further towards the edge of the Cambridge bubble, and the common room means that I still get to see most of my friends every day.

On the whole I can highly recommend both Blantyre and this room, and I hope everything goes well for you if you're stressed out trying to decide where you want to live :) Libbie x
