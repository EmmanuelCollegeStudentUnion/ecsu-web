2015 - This is a great room (rumour has it the 4 attic rooms are the best grade 1s in college...) It is quite cosy with the sloping ceilings. This one looks over the road which is nice to people watch from, and noise has never been a problem for me.

Pros - Characterful and well sized room for the money, is a full length mirror just outside, can be nice if you can get a group of 3 other friends in the other attic rooms.

Cons - Can be a little isolating at times - not like Old South where people wonder into your room. The lighting is pretty terrible, bring as many lamps as you can. There isn't very much storage room. There's no running water on the floor - but you are paying for a Grade 1.
