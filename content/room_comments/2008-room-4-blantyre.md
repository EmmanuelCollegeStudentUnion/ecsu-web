AVOID THIS ROOM! Small - two bed lengths by three bed widths.  Fairly thin walls. Dark and dingy, north facing, little natural light.  I was moved out of this room due to MOULD growing in the wardrobe - lots of my clothes being badly damaged.  the whole room is damp.  bursary and maintenance refused to accept there was a problem, and so probably won't rectify it.
