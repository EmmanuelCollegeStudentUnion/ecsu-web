This was the last room to be picked in my year.

It is relatively small but I think you could do MUCH MUCH worse. Before coming to live in this room I was really worried about what it would be like but it's really grown on me - I rather like it.

Blantyre in general is rather nice. There has been a bit of a reputation over the last few years of it being a "mathmo-compsci-physical natsci house" where no one really knows each other but this year that was not the case and it has been wonderful. If you can get a group of friends to live in Blantyre house then you will have a wonderful time!

It's a reasonable length but not very wide - it's probably about as wide as three beds side by side and probably almost as long as 2 beds end on.

The view is overlooking the garden which is nice. You have a sink. This is very near the common room so you can go there if you want to be social but the room is far enough away so as to not get noise if the common room is noisy.

Toilets and showers are about 10 seconds away.

This is probably not a room to go for if you like entertaining people but that being said you can easily get 4/5 in to watch a film.

In summary - not your first choice of room but you could do considerably worse. Nice for a grade 2.
