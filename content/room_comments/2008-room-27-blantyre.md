It's a nice room: square, quite spacious for its grade, and light. Faces the garden. No sink, but it's not an issue - there are 2 bathrooms just behind the corner, as well as a small kitchen. There are two huge wardrobes, a chair, and a chest of drawers. 

It is right opposite the shared room, which hasn't been an issue for me at all, but it might be if you are too sensitive to noise levels.
