Overall a fab room, decent size, you get used to all the stairs quickly and the view makes it worth it! (looks out into North Court) Plenty of light - large window (with window seat!) lets in the morning sun, and then very bright overhead lights in the room for the rest of the day. 

Lots of storage space - wardrobe, chest of drawers, 2 cupboards and shelves, and desk drawers.

Staircase was renovated end of 2014 so everything is nice and shiny! There's the tiniest gyp room ever next door (shared with T24), which is useful for its sink and microwave. Slightly larger kitchen next to T25 which is shared by all 6 rooms on floor, with microwave and 2 hobs. One shower, two toilets between the floor, I've not had a problem with queuing for the shower or anything.

Never had an issue with noise, and you can always close outer door that shuts off this and T24 from the rest of the corridor. Also ignore what it says above, there is both wired and wireless internet.
