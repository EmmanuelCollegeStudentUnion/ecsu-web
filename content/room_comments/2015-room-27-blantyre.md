A good room. Square, high ceilings, with a good amount of floor space. The storage space is fantastic- a decent sized chest of drawers and very large inbuilt cupboards. Shelves and small additional table are useful for bits and bobs. Desk overlooks garden, which is a nice touch. Heating works very well.It is just around the corner from two bathrooms (1 with shower) and a good kitchen (with hobs).

It isn't spectacular by any means, but I would certainly recommend this room. I have very few complaints.
