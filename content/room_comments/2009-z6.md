Great Room! Good for entertainment and for quiet study! Very large for a Grade 4, has two windows facing North Court and a small window (double-glazed) facing Emmanuel St. There is a toilet, a shower, a sink and a washing-up basin immediately outside. There is a reasonably sized kitchen on the 1st floor. Two large radiators (you can switch them on/off). One downside, this room does not get very much natual light, but this can be nice for midday naps :) It currently has a bright red carpet and pale orange walls, but it is going to be redecorated in the summer 2009.
