Great room. Very quiet. Obviously this depends on your neighbours - the room however is generally away from corridors/staircase/common room/roads which are potential sources of noise. Your get the nicest gyp room in the house to pretty much yourself and two others. Very spacious - enough to have wrestling matches, albeit very quiet ones as the housekeeper is just underneath. Huuuuge windows - let lots of light in!  Asian not included. Only qualms are: too vast especially when you sometimes forget something on the other side of the room, study table chair sucks, study table leaches brown stuff when wet. Wifi connection is not great, but wired is ridiculously fast.
