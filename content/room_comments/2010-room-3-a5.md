I agree with 2008's comments. Yes it is quite loud but it doesn't really bother me so much. I really love how nice and light it is and the fact you can see most of the way down st andrew's st. The room is small for a grade 4, but it is so handily situated.

Only bad things are that the gyp room is a cupboard with a microwave and a sink and the shower is tepid and has been all year despite complaining.
