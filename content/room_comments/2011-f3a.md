A large set, with some good items of furniture (e.g. dresser, shelves, big table) but pretty cruddy decor. The bedrooms don't seem to have been done up in a while. Also, the paddock-facing room is rendered almost uninhabitable by the extreme slope of the floor. Good gyp room, with large fridge and useful sink. If you live here, make sure to bring quite a lot of your own stuff, otherwise the shared room will seem pretty empty.
