A really nice room, renovated in 2014. A lot bigger than the grade 2 would suggest. Also see comment for room 23, alot of the comments apply because the rooms are neighbouring. It isn't court facing but is high enough to be above the wall so you get a lot of sun. 

Overall I've loved living here this year and would definitely recommend.o
