The room (as with most rooms in hostel) is split into two - a large living space and a smaller bedroom space. The rooms on this side of the building obviously receive less natural light than those facing the paddock, but I haven't found it too dark at all, even through the winter months. 

This whole side of the building was double glazed last Summer (2012) so the noise from the street isn't a problem at all - you can barely hear it. There's plenty of storage space (wardrobe, chest of drawers, wall unit with shelves and cupboards). 

The room has a sink and is handy in being right next to the loo on the ground floor of the staircase, so you don't have to pop down into the basement - good for laziness. H staircase has 3 kitchens - the top and bottom floor ones have hobs, and the middle floor kitchen has a combi oven.
