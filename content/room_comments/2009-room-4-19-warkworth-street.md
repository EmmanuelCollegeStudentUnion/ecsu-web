Absolutely huge room! Has two large windows and is south-ish facing so get's loads of natural light. Shower on the same floor, floor above has gyp room and toilet/bath, floor below has toilet. 

Has lot's of furniture due to its size. Decent size coffee table with 2 seat sofa and then another 2 single 'comfy' chairs. Also, standard desk and chair with lamp, fridge, small wardrobe, shelves and cupboards. There's a sink also. Only 1 heater but the room never gets too cold. Walls and carpet not in the most amazing condition but that's a really minor issue. Advice would be to bring loads and loads of posters/decorations otherwise it's so big that it starts to look bare!!

The house has a really massive basement kitchen as well for group meals. Definitely recommend the room and house!
