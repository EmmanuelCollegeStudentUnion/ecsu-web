This room is a nice size for a Grade 2: it's got plenty of wardrobe space and storage on top of it and under the bed.  It has all the mod-cons: standard bed, newish fridge, desk, vaguely uncomfortable desk chair and another much comfier chair which is unfortunately too low for the desk.  

Being on the south-west side of the house, you are precariously positioned above the housekeeper, but I haven't found it a problem as the room's size isn't that well suited for socialising.  You're also a long way from the common room, which is good for noise levels, but may be a drain on your social life.  On the plus side, you're right next door to one of the kitchens, which is nice and big and only gets used by immediate neighbours on the corridor.  There's also plenty of storage space in there for utensils if it gets too full in your room.

The room faces the street so there's not much of a view and occasionally there's a bit of noise at night or early morning, but it's not been a problem for me. It also doesn't get much sun in the mornings or in midwinter, but there's usually a nice glow in the afternoon and the main light is good and bright once it's warmed up.  The heating hasn't been a problem at all and even on the coldest nights you might find yourself too warm if the radiator is on full blast.

As with all Blantyre rooms, you're a long way from college so handing in work in the small hours can be a drag, and unless you've got a friendly chef nearby or want to eat Domino's every night, you may have to cook regularly.  I've found eating at hall for lunch means you can usually eat light in the evening, though.

All in all, a very nice, comfortable room with few problems.
