title: Room 14, East Court
year: '2009'

this room is really nice, especially good value for a grade one- no sink and not massive but bigger than the grade 3 ones in east court which have sinks- has a nice cosy feel. looking out onto the street so quite noisy but not terrible. storeage=big wardrobe, drawers, shelves. pretty mantlepiece although fireplace itself filled in.
