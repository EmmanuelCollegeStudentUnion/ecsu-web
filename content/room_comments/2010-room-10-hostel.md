Agree with all the statements made in the previous comment. Really loved this room - LOTS of space & storage, perfect for having friends over, great homely feel, lovely view of the paddock from the well stocked kitchen. The room also has a great wireless signal which is always a bonus!

Negative points are: only one toilet in the staircase on the ground floor (but plenty more can be found in the basement, along with showers and bathtubs). Bedroom can also get a bit chilly in winter since the radiator is in the living room.

Other than that, it's a really great room which I would highly recommend!
