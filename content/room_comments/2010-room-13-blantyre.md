Sensual, just sensual - get this room! Probably amongst the best grade threes in college, previous comments about heating no longer apply, I found its pretty reliable and easily adjusted. Carpets aren't all that grotty either, all in all probably the best value room in Blantyre and a very nice place to pass a year (especially if you don't get out much).
