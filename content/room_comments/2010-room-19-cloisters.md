Room is in an interesting L-shape, which I liked, because I think it makes the room *look* bigger than others in the block, but a lot of visiting friends didn't seem too keen. Common problems plaguing all these new cloisters rooms include showers becoming blocked quite easily and the radiator only gets a bit warm in winter even at maximum setting. Overall though, I did like the room quite a lot.
