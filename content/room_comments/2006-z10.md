Positives: Large room, good wardrobe and chest of drawers and desk, recently been decorated so nice walls and rich green carpet. Also room is pretty soundrpoof so you can play your music loudly, right next door to the kitchen.

Negatives: Its a bit dingy so you need to buy a few lamps and extra lighting, the road can be a bit noisy, low ceilings which don't bother me but if you are tall it will, no sink which can be a bit annoying. 

All in all its a pretty good room.
