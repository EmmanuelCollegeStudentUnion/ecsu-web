title: Room 11, Cloisters
year: '2014'
---

Advantages: very warm, lots of cupboard space, quiet (can hear people in the corridor but nothing at all from the next door room or the kitchen down the corridor), best thing about the room is the en-suite bathroom! Also, great kitchen with lots of hobs and a dining table - really good for having people over.

Disadvantages: this room is the smallest on the corridor, you can hear extractor fans from the buildings outside when the windows are open.
