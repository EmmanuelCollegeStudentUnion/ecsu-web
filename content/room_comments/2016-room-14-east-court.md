A lovely little room for a Grade 2. As people have said before, noisy with the windows open, but you definitely get used to the traffic at night. Lack of sink isn't ideal, but make friends with people in New East and they won't mind if you use their showers/bathrooms rather than having to go downstairs every time! Great storage, nice layout of the room.
