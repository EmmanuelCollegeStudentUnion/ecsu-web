Two spacious rooms with a very good wifi connection and sink. I've liked living in this room, but it could do with more storage space and, being in the basement, there isn't much natural light. But, there are multiple bathrooms and kitchens nearby, and all the kitchens have hobs! There are three showers, one of them particularly nice, but the building is a bit like a rabbit warren. You get used to it though.
