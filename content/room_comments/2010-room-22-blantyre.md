This room is perfect. It's absolutely massive (apparently the largest room outside of college), has a really big bay window and a marble fireplace. It has two doors, one leading to the porch area of Blantyre and the other leading to the bathrooms and toilets etc. 

It is a really great part of the house: next to two really good showers, a toilet so close to your room it's basically en-suite, the laundry and a kitchen that is shared with 23 and 24. 

Despite the size of the room, it stays really warm in the winter. 

I guess the only disadvantages of this room is that the wired internet doesn't really work (the wireless signal is really strong though, so this doesn't really matter) and because it's next to the housekeeper, you can't really have big parties in here. She's pretty reasonable though, so I wouldn't let that put you off!
