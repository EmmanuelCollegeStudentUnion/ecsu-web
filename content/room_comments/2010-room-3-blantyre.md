Room 3's a decent grade 3 and in good shape - recently painted with pretty moldings on the ceiling. Large patio doors which are poorly insulated so I keep the curtains shut when I leave. Also not the best room if you're worried about security as it's on the ground floor but it faces the garden rather than the street. 

Toilet and sink right next door and kitchen round the corner which is only really used by rooms 1, 2 and 3. 

It's the closest room to the common room and by the stairs so it can get noisy. 

Great place to live, especially if you're good friends with the people in 1 and 2.
