Good sized (much bigger than the Garde 3 next door) pleasant blue painted room with windows on two walls (so v bright).  Far enough from common room to get peace when you don't fancy being kept awake.  Basin is handy for brushing teeth/make up/shaving(??), but other than that a bit useless - water doesn't taste drinkable and hot and cold taps both run luke warm.  Got back after Christmas hols to a FREEZING room since it has three external walls and the roof, which took about a week to warm up.  Would recommend Blantyre for the speedy wired internet and great common area (but it's a long way from the boathouse!).
