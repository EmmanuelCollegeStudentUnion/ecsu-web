Really enjoyed living here. For me, having one of the biggest (if not the biggest) kitchens in old court was a big advantage for this room. And if you choose the right person, it really is loads of fun sharing a set.  

Being close to Front Court and being ground floor does make you wary of security more but as long as you do remember to lock your windows before you leave then you'll (probably) be fine. You will get tourists peeking in through the main window but I've never found it a problem and you can close the curtains after all.

Both bedrooms can get rather a lot of noise (from Spoons or just people walking past on Paddock side). One of the biggest old court sets though, and really good bedroom sizes for both people.

If you're even considering Old Court you're probably aware of the loo/shower situation but then by next year you may well have loos and showers in Old Court anyway...
