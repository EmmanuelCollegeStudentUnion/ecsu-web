These Attic rooms are actually really great value for money and a lot more cosy than other rooms. They don't have a sink which is a downside, but otherwise the room is lovely, very easy to personalise and I actually like the sloping ceiling bit - gives it a bit of character.

Definitely bring extra lamps though - the central light-bulb is a bit limited.
