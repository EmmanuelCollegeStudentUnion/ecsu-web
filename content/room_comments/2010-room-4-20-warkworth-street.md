Quite nice really, one wall has suffered form the dreaded blue tak other than that it looks fine.  View over the back garden/gravel car park is nice.  The radiator has three settings - on, off and somewhere in between that makes a weird clicking noise.  you also have a lovely set of pipes in one corner that goes to the shower so you know if its in use because you can hear it.
