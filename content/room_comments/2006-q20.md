A cute little room for a grade 2.  On the top floor of Q.  Has a (just about) walk in wardrobe and a fireplace.  Nice big window, but not a great view - looking out over the back of subway/ sovinos/burger king.  A bath on our floor, a shower the floor below.  Decent amount of storage.  Far away from buses, really has been very quiet really. 

I pefer this room to my grade 3 one last year.
