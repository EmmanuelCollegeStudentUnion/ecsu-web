Nice big room. View is over the bus station which isn't the most beautiful thing in the world, but still lets in enough light. I was worried about bus noise but in practice the double glazing keeps the room pretty quiet. Currently (Lent 2015) contains:

Sofa, armchair, bed, bed-side table, two coffee tables, fridge, chest of drawers, two cupboards, a desk and 4 shelves.
