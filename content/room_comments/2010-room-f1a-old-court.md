As old court sets go, it is one of them.

Bad points: no mini-gyp-room (as most other sets have)but a sink, fridge and microwave in the room; can be pretty dark (lamps v recommended); paddock facing bedroom has little to no privacy.

Good things: great views onto the paddock and into the willow tree on the other side (not even sarcastically - it really is an awesome tree view); a noteworthy old wardrobe in the chapman garden facing bedroom; paddock facing bedroom great for exhibitionists.
