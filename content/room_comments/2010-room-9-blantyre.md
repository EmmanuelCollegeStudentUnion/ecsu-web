Great room, especially in summer.

Key Advantages:

French Doors means really easy access to the bike sheds of a morning / the garden in the summer / lets the air in. 

Doors and Window let a lot of light into the room.

The Neighbours friendly cat occasionally comes round the doors (Disadvantage maybe?) But he doesn't come in. 

Nice and big with Desk, Wardrobe, Chest of Drawers, coffee table and three chairs.

Disadvantages:

No sink

The shower on this side of the house isn't the best, but it's not too bad.

The kitchen tends to get all the crockery that's been left in the common room (though this applies to rooms 4-10 too)

Two outside walls means it can get a little colder in winter than everywhere else. Wasn't an issue for me since i'm northern! :)
