title: Room 3, 3 Park Terrace

A really nice room: big, high celling, loads of chairs, retains heat better than the rest of the house, very near to the kitchen and the bathroom. Real lack of natural light though, as south facing, and the extension with the kitchen in blocks out almost all the daylight.

Room 6 is the best room in the house though: bigger, better lit, facing Parker's Piece, and with a separate bedroom.
