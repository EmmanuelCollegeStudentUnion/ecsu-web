It's a good room. Square, but a decent size. It faces the garden and gets sun until about midday. Lacks a sink, but this isn't really a problem with two bathrooms close by. Gets a bit of corridor noise and the wall with #28 is a bit thin, which may or may not be an issue. Window ledge is good for sitting out on.
