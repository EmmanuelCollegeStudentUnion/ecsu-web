Agree with all of the positive points- it's a really nice room. The kitchen is nice and it's very convenient that the laundry service is in the basement. Slightly annoying that the toilet and showers are a few flights of stairs away but you quickly get used to it. However, the heating in this room (as with all rooms at the top of H) is not so great. There's only one radiator in the corner of the lounge so the bedroom doesn't get any heat. Also the wireless internet signal is not very good. Despite this I would definitely recommend this room!
