Good:- AWESOME location. I can't explain how good it is to get up 5 mins before lecture and be EARLY not just on time.

- Convenience: Everything is within about a minute away (Freepos, Hall, Pidgeonholeroom, cash machine, library, john lewis, subway, more restaurants, bank, post office, revs and cindies)

- Good size for grade 3.

- Nice view.

- Flat arrangement is really really cool if you have nice people.

- Best person to shower ratio on college without being ensuite.

Bad:

- Bad heating/insulation = gets cold.

- Beepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeep from street.

- General traffic/revs, but you get used to it.

- Shower is crap. Cold and limp.

- Small kitchen but actually not that bad and you can make it work.
