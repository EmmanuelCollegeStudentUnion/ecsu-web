The attics rooms are huge for grade ones, they have more floor space than some grade threes in college but the space you can use/stand up in gets smaller depending on how tall you are, thanks to the sloping roof, but I'm 5'10" and it hasn't been too bad. For all the annoyance of the slope it adds character to the room and feels a lot less generic than your standard south court room.

There is lots of storage space too, also, definitely bring a spare lamp/light it can get pretty dingy if you don't.
