Quite spacious for a grade 3 - loads of storage space. Big desk and nice shelvey things in a little alcove. Recently painted, re-carpeted and re-curtained in greeny shades (not as bad as it sounds at all!!) 

On same floor as toilet and shower, bath is upstairs. Gyp room (..microwave room) is downstairs. 

Bus station view - not too noisy at all with double glazing - hardly  notice it (though sunday mornings are a good time to air your room as the buses are way quieter on sundays!!) , might be stuffy in the summer (but i had a similar facing room last year and it was ok).

Bad points: standardly bad cooking facilities as with all of north court. Person on the floor below will probably have a piano, but again this is the case in lots of north court rooms. THE DOOR AUTOMATICALLY LOCKS IF IT ISNT LATCHED. (not exactly a bad point...but its not great to be locked out your room at 3am when a bit drunk!). 

Great choice if u are low in the ballot and happy to live in college.
