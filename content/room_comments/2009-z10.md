This is a lovely room, with a huge window and the only reason i think it is a grade three is because the bus station is right outside the window. The noise isn't bothersome for the majority of the time as there is double glazing, There isn't a sink in the room, but one just outside that me and my neighbour share, which is good. Shower facilities aren't great though, but toilets are opposite the room and there is a gyp room next door.
