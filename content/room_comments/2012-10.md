Actually quite a big room, but feels a bit smaller because of the slanted roof. Only one small window, but it's fine. Like the person before said, tiny doors through to 5 and 15, which are great if you know those people as it saves a ridiculously long walk. Main downside - 2 floors down just for a sink, as well as toilets, showers, kitchens etc. You do get used to it though (eventually). 

If you're low in the ballot though it's definitely one of the best you could go for though.
