The room itself is a bit of a cupboard but as long as you like the person in 32B the living room provides ample space for any cat swinging you may wish to indulge in. Both rooms and the living room have been decorated this year (2007). Room has big window and built-in wardrobe, small desk, chest of drawers, and shelf space. Bring a lamp for the living room and wear lots of socks as it gets a tad chilly. Blantyre itself is a fantastic place to live provided you know and like the other residents. Only place in college with a common room/dining room/tv room. Hobs aplenty at the time of writing.
