title: Room 4, Hostel

H4 is a great room - like most rooms in Hostel there is a separate living room and bedroom.  It's really big, with good furniture/storage and a sink and two mirrors!  It's also fairly light, despite being on the back of the building, it never feels dingy, and the new double-glazing keeps a lot of the heat in.  Only negatives are it's a bit loud with the buses going past in the night, and the bedroom gets a bit cold because the only radiator is in the living room.  There's a kitchen on the same floor with no hobs, but there are hobs upstairs and downstairs so it's not a problem at all.  Basically, it's great, I wouldn't say the problems I mentioned were substantial and it's a really sociable place to live with 4 rooms looking onto a hallway and kitchen.
