title: Room J1b, Hostel
year: '2016'

The most important thing to note about the ground floor of J is that it is very much a working corridor; the Housekeeper has her office in J2, the laundry is downstairs and so is the main housekeeping office. This has some clear benefits, such as being first in line for the laundry (if you wake up early), but it can also make the room a bit noisy - it's directly above the washing machines (though you filter this out quickly) and the housekeeping staff arrive earlier in the morning than the average (non-boatie) student wakes up. 

On the subject of noise, the walls with 1a and the corridor are thin enough to hear conversations (as well as coughing etc) clearly, but the wall with 3 is thick. This can mean that the room sometimes gets noisy at night. My solution is ear plugs, which can be purchased relatively cheaply and in bulk online.

Sitting at the desk to type a review biases it, because J1b has one of the best views in college, directly across the paddock. This can mean though that during the day the sun is often in your eyes as you work (the room being South facing), although I have not found this to be a huge problem. In terms of being light at night, opening the wardrobe door to its fullest extent mitigates this.

As previous occupants have said, the storage is very good - a large wardrobe, a chest of draws and four large shelves. There is also a desk with draws (one lockable, but no sign of the key), a low coffee table, a small bedside table, two chairs and a fridge. The room is not large (with Hostel's high ceilings, it is actually taller than it is wide), but not really tiny either. The loo and gyp opposite and showers downstairs are also convenient.
