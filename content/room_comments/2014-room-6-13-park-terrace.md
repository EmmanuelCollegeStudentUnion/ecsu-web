As the previous comment states, it's a small room but a comfortable size. The room faces Parker's Piece and has a great view - especially of sunrise and sunset! You do get some noise from traffic and loud people on the streets outside, but the noise level isn't too high to bother (at least for me). I'm told the kitchen in the attic is one of the biggest in college, and it has a table and benches for you to sit at to eat. Bathroom now has a shower (hot water works fine), showerhead isn't too fantastic but still okay. PT13 is often used for guests and grads, so you may get people coming/moving in and out, but they're on the levels below and have their own toilet facilities. Lastly, soundproofing between rooms is quite good, so if your doors are closed it's hard to hear your neighbours!
