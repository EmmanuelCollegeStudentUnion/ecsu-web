For a grade 1, this room is really not bad at all. It's on the ground floor, which isn't ideal, and next to the door which can be quite noisy, it has no sink and is fairly near the housekeeper. However, it has a very high ceiling and enormous window which make it very light and airy, it has been recently redecorated with pale green walls and a green carpet (and matching green chair!), it is very near two showers, a kitchen and the laundry, and storage space is ample. Do not despair at all if you get this room - it's really quite nice, and definitely not poky or cramped.
