Really nice room. All the comments above are accurate; the only thing I'd add is that I've moved the desk so it's now by the fireplace and not in full view of the road!

Pros of this room: cheap, pretty big, nicely decorated, lots of storage, on nice side of the house, next to all the showers and laundry facilities.

Cons: right next to housekeeper (although this isn't actually a problem, she's lovely as long as you're nice to her!), road is a bit loud and distracting, although only at 'peak' times of the day. Net curtains (new!) help a lot.
