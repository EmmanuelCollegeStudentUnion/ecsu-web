Small but nice room with a lovely view of the paddock. Gets really nice light all day and has a big window. Toilet and gyp room (with hobs) directly opposite so not having a sink isn't a huge issue. Showers and baths are downstairs in the basement. Can be quite a loud room as can hear chatting in the corridor/ outside the window/ in 1a next door. Very decent storage, and not bad value for a grade 3.
