title: Room 17, Blantyre
year: '2008'

The room is reasonably sized. It has a sink which is a bonus. The shower nearby is absolutely freezing. And the walls between 15/16 and 17 are really thin. If you are friendly with them it'll probably work out ok... otherwise you might want to invest an amp or some large speakers. That's what I did. The door to the rooom closes annoyingly slowly and during the day light comes in from the one window all day long. You might think this would be good... but it is too bright really and you have draw the curtains. The desk is very large and features wings, and the storage space is adequate. The internet in Blantyre is poor. Wireless and wired are provided but they are very variable in terms of being on. Blantyre is an 11 minute walk from college. Cooking facilities are limited.
