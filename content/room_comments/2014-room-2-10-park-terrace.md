Room 2, Park Terrace 10 is a very large square-shaped room on the ground floor with two large windows that give on Parker's Piece. Park terrace is great because you have street access right around the corner from sainsbury's local but mainly everyone cuts through the garden straight into college and its very close to hostel for laundry. PT10 has not been renovated recently but its decent and there are 2 toilets, 1 shower and 1 very GYP room for 4 people.

No sink in this room but many chairs, a huge double cupboard and a wardrobe for clothes plus plenty of shelves and a chimney. Ground floor means you can hear the front door slam when someone uses it and there is sometimes noise for parkers piece (some buses during the day) but shutters + the fact everyone uses the back door limits noise. Can sometimes through the wall if Room 3 is being extremely loud.
