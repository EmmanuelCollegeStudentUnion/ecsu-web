title: Room 2, Blantyre
year: '2015'

It's really big, especially for a grade 2, and has a near-private kitchen and bathroom. I've never really had any problems with noise from the common room or road, although you don't have much privacy and it gets a bit cold in winter. Overall I think it's one of the better rooms in Blantyre.
