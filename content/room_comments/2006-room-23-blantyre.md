title: Room 23, Blantyre
year: '2006'

This room has been newly painted and carpeted (both green) this year and feels very fresh.  As the previous person said it has plenty of storage space and the size is fine - it's not big but it's certainly not poky.  My only concern is that my laptop sits on my desk in full view of passers-by!  It's a nice room other than that though.
