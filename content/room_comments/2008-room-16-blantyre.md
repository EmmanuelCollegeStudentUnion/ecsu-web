title: Room 16, Blantyre
year: '2008'

Like all Blantyre rooms, carpeted and repainted last summer. Very Small, but a nice room plus has a sink with storage underneath. Double glazed window, unlike most other rooms, and gets the sun in during the afternoon.

Very good for a grade 2, the only bad point being the small size
