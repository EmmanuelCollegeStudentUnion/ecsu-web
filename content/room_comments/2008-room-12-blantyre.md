title: Room 12, Blantyre
year: '2008'

This room is pretty large with a bay window that faces onto the street. You get a fair amount of noise coming from outside, but mostly just people talking rather than cars, as there isnt much traffic. It can get a little cold because the windows are not double glazed. There is a gorgeous fireplace and there are two bathrooms and a kitchen very close by. A very good choice of room.
