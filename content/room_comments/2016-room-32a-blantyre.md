It's a very pokey room, but the living room, with it's chairs and extra cupboard, makes up for it - so be sure that you're sharing it with a good friend. There's good shelving and wardrobe space, though the desk could be bigger. A downside is that the room is North-facing, so the natural light comes in mostly in the last hour of daylight.

Living in Blantyre does mean getting used to slightly longer journeys to lectures (/supos/Hall/library/Cindies) or just being 5 min late to everything. Apart from that, it's a lovely place to live - very homely. The common room is fab (with a TV!), there a loads of kitchens and the distance from Hall means that many people share cooking, and there are loads of baths. Clean, nice baths.
