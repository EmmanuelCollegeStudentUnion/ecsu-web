I would agree with previous comments - the shared lounge is really convenient for having guests, and this room is nice and large. The bathrooms (choice of bath or shower! The luxury!) and kitchens are really clean, and big, and also there is wireless internet at Blantyre - I don't know why it says there isn't. I haven't had any problems with noise, but there is a bin lorry which comes a few times a week in the morning, which might wake up light sleepers. Still get rooms hoovered and bins emptied. And once you've done the walk a few times, Blantyre doesn't seem so far away! All in all, this is a really great room - probably only an option for people high up in the ballot!
