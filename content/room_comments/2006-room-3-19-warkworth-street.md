This is one of the smaller rooms in the house but easily big enough.  Faces the back towards the grafton centre so fairly quiet.  Lots of shelving space above the desk, a small wardrobe but a decent size chest of drawers.  Carpet and walls are not especially new but they are not too bad.  Same floor as the shower.  The kitchen is this house is really good as it has a table and chairs to sit round.
