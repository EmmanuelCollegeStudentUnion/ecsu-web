Lovely flat type arrangement up here, four people sharing, quite nice if you can find three friends. Gyp room is quite small with just a microwave. Shower has been largely cold all year, but is now apparently fixed, I'm not convinced and am continuing to use other ones. Ridiculously convenient for lectures, post room, hall and freepos machine.

Window only lets in light in the morning- thus all my plants have died.

Lots of storage space- the wardrobe is huge. In fact I'm fairly sure several people could fit inside it.

You can also hear the cries of "SPEEECH!" after formal hall, which can be genuinely entertaining.
