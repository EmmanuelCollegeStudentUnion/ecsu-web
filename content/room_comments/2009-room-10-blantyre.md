If you want an en suite, then you can't really do better than this for value for money.  The room itself is nice and seems to have been recently redecorated.  It's an OK size but there's no coffee table and only one extra chair so it's not that easy to entertain guests.  I tend to keep my curtain shut since it's on the ground floor which makes it a little dark.  Last year's comment about the bed being next to the shower worried me but noise hasn't been a problem at all.  The kitchen is nice and big and has a hob.  I really like this room.
