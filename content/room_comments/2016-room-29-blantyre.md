Lovely Room. 

There's not much to add to what people have already written.

The 2 huge windows are fantastic with lovely surroundings, bird song in the mornings and very low road noise. There's also loads of floor space, so it's great if you want to have a few friends over for dinner.

Heating- previous occupants have said it's cold at night but I've found keeping the radiator on high keeps the room perfectly warm (even if the energy wastage is shameful). 

I'm quite aghast to hear that there have been "juicy spider" issues, as I have not come across any yet...(I'm nervous now). I can indeed vouch for the ladybird issue though - I had 200 this Michaelmas (yes, procrastination made me count them), which is fine if you're into nature but not so fine if you can't deal with them flying around your room while you sleep in November and slowly dying on your floor in January.

One other downside, although quite clearly stated is that there is no sink/basin, which can be quite frustrating at times but having said that, the room is right next to the biggest and probably least busy kitchen in the house.

This room is the perfect getaway from Cambridge's hecticness and great value for money (still at grade 3).
