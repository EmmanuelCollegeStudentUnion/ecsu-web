Lovely room with lots of natural light and a sink. Close to both the kitchen and the bathroom and very nice olive branch themed curtains which compliment the magnolia hue of the walls. Only issue is rattling/drafty windows which and not very soundproof - raucous hooligans including the Anglia Ruskin football team can often be heard patrolling the streets in the early hours of the morning, but don't usually try to gain entry. Frequent road rage incidents occur outside the window which can be a good aid to procrastination. The nicest Warkworth house - overall 10/10 would recommend to a friend.
