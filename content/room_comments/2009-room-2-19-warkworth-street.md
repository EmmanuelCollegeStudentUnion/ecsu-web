This room is fairly big, with nice walls and carpet, and plenty of storage space and built-in wardrobe. It's really peaceful as the room is at the back of the house facing towards the yard- useful for bikes and carparking when moving in. Has toilet on same floor and shower just above and big kitchen directly below with hob and table for group meals. Would seriously recommend!
