Thin walls, but this doesn't tend to be a problem if you're only noisy in the living room. Gigantic room. One plug socket in bedroom, two in living room, two in "kitchen" - bring extension leads. Sink in bedroom, takes ages to run hot water. Bigger fridge than in any other single room in college. The "kitchen" is about as big as a wardrobe, but quite a lot of storage space. Comes with a microwave, nobody seems to mind you having a kettle and toaster. Stairs are a bit scary when you're drunk and wearing heels, although this is probably partly why I haven't been portered despite loud parties.

Furniture: one cabinet, one chest of drawers, one desk with drawers, one normal-sized wardrobe, a bed, two armchairs, two wooden chairs, a coffee table, a bedside table, a writing desk (works well as a food prep area). I advise bringing a lamp and a big rug to make the room less sparse, and maybe some cushions to use as extra seating, and a radiator key because the room is at the top of the college heating system so radiators need to be bled every fortnight or so. This may be a good thing come summer, when roaring heating isn't exactly desired.

Two windows in each room, so gorgeous views over the paddock and chapman's garden. Not a huge amount of light, especially in the late afternoon/early evening.

Internet connection is via wireless which is pretty temperamental.

Toilets & showers being in South Court is a right pain, but the facilities are quite good when you actually make it down there. Best room I've ever had in college. Awesome party venue.
