This room is very much in the attic. I quite liked it, but being 5'3'', the low sloping ceilings don't bother me all that much. There isn't much standing room if you're tall though, as the roof is tall in the middle and slopes down both sides. There are windows on both sides, (but on one side they are pretty small), and a small window seat which looks out onto Parker's Piece. When the wind blows, it is pretty loud, and the room could really use with a paint job (there are tape/blu-tac stains all over the ceilings) and even a huge hole in the wall, but cover it with photos and it's fine.
