All in all, it's a nice room with a really good view over the paddock. There's a lot of natural sunlight, which is lovely, although this can be a problem when the weather gets warmer - it makes the room almost too bright and warm! There is a big fireplace and molding all around the walls. It's also bigger than J1a and b for the same price. The biggest issue I've had with the room has been the lack of storage space - rather than a wardrobe, there are just some racks built in around the fireplace. Instead of a chest and drawers, there are two small cupboards, and two small sets of shelves. I found this a bit annoying, but I think it really depends how much stuff you have.
