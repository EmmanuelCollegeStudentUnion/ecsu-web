Small but perfectly comfortable. Great view of Parker's Piece. Traffic is noisy, if that kind of thing bothers you. Heating is just right. Lovely, large kitchen one floor above and bathroom one half floor below. Bathroom is cold and has no shower, just a bath with a rubber hose attachment. Otherwise, no13 is particularly nice house as mostly used by guests and grads.
