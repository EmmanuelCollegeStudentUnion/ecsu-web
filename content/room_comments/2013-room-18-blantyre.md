title: Room 18, Blantyre

18 is a lovely attic room (though maybe not good for tall people!) Grade one so no sink, but bathrooms and kitchen just downstairs, so its not inconvenient at all! Plenty of space and lots of shelf/ cupboard storage space :) Can get slightly dark so an extra light is nice! But apart from that a great room and you can really make it your own :D See room 21 for more photos as all attic rooms are the same shape/size.
