title: Room 27, Blantyre

Nice room - big for a grade 3 and good value for money. Great storage space with built-in wardrobes and drawers. Light pink walls and relatively ok curtains (for college). Only problems are a very very thin wall with number 28 and can lack natural light in the afternoons. Internet works fine and close to two good bathrooms and the best kitchen in Blantyre (big with combi-oven, hob and lots of cupboard space).
