A bright and cheerful room, cosy but spacious enough. The sink is handy and it's also right next to a bathroom with toilet and shower. A bit of a trek to the kitchen (there's a little gyp room in the basement of 20 with microwaves, and a nice bigger kitchen in the basement of 19 with a hob), which means negotiating lots of doors and can be annoying when trying to cook in a rush/carry food between kitchen and room, but not a big problem. I really like the marble mantelpiece, and the recently-painted walls which with decoration make the room very cheerful. Being at the back of the house it doesn't get as much sunlight as other rooms, but again not a big problem at all. Overall brilliant for grade 3!
