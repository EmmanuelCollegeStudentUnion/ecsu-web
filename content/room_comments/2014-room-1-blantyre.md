Great room as it's so large. Really nice big windows but I've rarely seen direct sunlight (through Michaelmas and Lent) as it's North facing. 

It is noisy when you hear the gate, and the common room noise can be quite annoying when trying to sleep. I have to wear earplugs which I don't mind but some people might. It's really nice to have a common room, there are often people in there working/chatting etc. It also means we don't have to invade anyone's space for socializing or celebrating.  

The kitchen is really handy, but very small which means that people other than from rooms 1, 2 and 3 don't tend to use it so not all bad (if a lot of people in the house are cooking sometimes you have to wait for a hotplate). Pretty sure most of the hotplates are working now though. Also there's 2 combi ovens in the whole house (not the nearby kitchen though).

The room has been really cold with the cold weather. The window is really drafty so lets in loads of cold air, so I have sometimes kept my curtains closed all day just so I don't freeze.

Would recommend this room, especially as it's only grade 2. A lot of people are surprised when they hear the grade just because it's so big. 

There's a bed, desk, large chest of drawers and cupboard, good shelf space, two coffee tables, desk chair + 2 arm chairs, fridge, no sink (don't need one with the kitchen next door).
