title: Room 10, East Court

Plenty of room on the floor, especially for East Court. A little bit dark, but nice. The stairs give you hench legs, but it can seem a long way to a kitchen or bathroom (which are pretty good, though kitchen directly underneath still lacks a hob). Generally East Court seems quite a busy enclave in college if you get a good group of people in. No complaints.
