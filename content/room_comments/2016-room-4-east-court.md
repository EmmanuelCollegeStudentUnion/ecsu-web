Not a big room, but not a tiny room either: can get up to eight people sat around fairly comfortably (more if you squeeze).

Has a chest of drawers and a good sized wardrobe.

Has a desk chair, an armchair, a coffee table and a small bedside table.

Not a very bright room, due to north-east facing aspect.

Noise from traffic can be loud, especially if windows are open.

No sink (nearest is in bathroom downstairs).
