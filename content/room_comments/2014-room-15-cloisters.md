I will have to disagree with the person from 2011. I lived in Q16, a room with windows within about 10 metres of cl15, in 2011-2012 and yes there was a fair amount of noise from the workshop for the renovations as well as the alarms on the building opposite. However this year, 2013-2014, I am yet to hear them at all.

However I will agree with the room being a little smaller than it's grade would lead on, however I would hardly call it small at all, you have a large wardrobe, chest of draws, good amount of shelf space and the ensuite, which is the main reason the room is small.

You will be woken up by staff arriving in the morning if you leave your window open at night, but that isn't a huge issue really, and you can't hear anything with the windows shut thanks to it being a new room.

So overall in my opinion I am very happy to have lived here, and yes it is a grade 7, but when it comes down to it, that isn't much more money than a grade 5 or 6 so definitely worth it.
