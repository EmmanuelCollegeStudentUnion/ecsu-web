year: '2010'

This room is way too small to be a grade 4, despite the view of parkers piece. It is the size of an average grade one room, and there is not even space for a coffee table. It's a nice enough room, and it helps that the house as a whole is great, but in terms of how its been graded it should never have been a grade 4, it should be a grade 2 or 3 at most!
