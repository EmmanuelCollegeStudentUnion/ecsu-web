title: Room 2, East Court

This is a generally nice room in the non-renovated part of East Court.

It's very spacious for a grade 2, and generally bigger than the 1st floor rooms. Relatively well-equipped, with a coffee table and easy chair that actually fit in the room. No basin, but this isn't a problem as two loos (one also has a suspiciously underused bathtub) are literally just outside the door, which is very convenient. One of the three kitchens of old East Court is also right downstairs. Also plenty of wall space for posters etc. 

The room faces out onto Parker street which means it isn't as quiet as the rooms on the other side of the building, but it's still not extremely noisy; personally have never had trouble sleeping, but might want to think about it only if you're a super light sleeper. 

Minor cons would include the wardrobe, which is annoyingly small for no apparent reason and kind of wobbly, and the small size of the fridge, though that goes for all of the building and there is actually a proper fridge in the kitchen. 

All in all, this is a rather nice room to go for in your second year;
