On the first floor, facing the bus station. The room is double glazed which cuts out almost all of the noise, and also keeps the room quite warm.

The room is a quite big and is very close to the shower/toilet. Unfortunately this means you can hear the flush (and the refill), which is quite loud, and lasts over a minute. This can get quite annoying. The room also doesn't get any light.

Overall, it's not too bad for a grade 3, but I'd recommend going for an inward facing room if possible. If you get this room, invest in some ear plugs. You will need them.
