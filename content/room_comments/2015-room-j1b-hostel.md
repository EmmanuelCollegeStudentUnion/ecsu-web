Great room. The light is lovely and streams over the desk when you work, and there is a brilliant view of the paddock. The room doesn't have a sink but it doesn't make any real difference because the kitchen and bathroom are directly opposite the door. There is lots of storage space, a big enough wardrobe and drawers plus shelving space for all your books. 

Heating is great and manual so can be switched on and off when needed. 

Issues: the wall with 1a is thin... you get used to it though, headphones come in handy but it depends on your neighbour really. 

It is a great room for a grade 3, just the right amount of space and you don't have to walk up all those stairs to get to your room. Kitchen facilities are fine too, with showers downstairs in the basement and laundry beneath you (which is really useful as you can get your laundry in first on a Monday morning before the hoards get there meaning a quick turn around).
