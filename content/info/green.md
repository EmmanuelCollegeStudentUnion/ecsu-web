title: Green

Emma is increasingly known for being a green-minded college. It has various environmental initiatives and systems within place - this page is intended to help you know what they are! For any questions or suggestions, please contact the green officer at [green@ecsu.org.uk](mailto:green@ecsu.org.uk).


## Recycling



- Every student should have two bins in their room - the green one is for general rubbish and the silver one for mixed recycling. The following can all go in your recycling bin (they will then be sorted): paper; plastic; cartons; cardboard; glass; tins; clean foil
<li>For more info, see Cambridge City Council's guide [here](https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/sites/www.cambridge.gov.uk/files/documents/what-goes-in-which-bin-poster.pdf) (blue bin guide).
</li>
- Whether you have a recycling bin in your kitchen or not depends on the size of the kitchen. If not, please use the recycling bins in your rooms!
- Your bedders should empty these bins separately and can usually help you if you have questions about the recycling, as can the green officer. 

## Bikes



- Pumps, WD40, bike oil, a puncture repair kit and tyre levers can be borrowed from the plodge for bike repairs. 
- There are covered bike storage sheds in Chapman\u2019s Garden, and otherwise bike racks throughout college to lock your bike securely.
- The CUSU shop offers the cheapest legal bike lights and advise on cycle safety in Cambridge, in particular [here](http://www.studentadvice.cam.ac.uk/welfare/cycling/). It also tells you which bike shops have student deals and discounts.
- You should register your bike with college (ask the porters) when arriving, and note down the reference code stamped into the frame in case it is stolen.

## Post

If you would like a green dot on your pidge to indicate that you don't want to receive leaflets/spam, please email the green officer at [green@ecsu.org.uk](mailto:green@ecsu.org.uk).



## Accommodation


- If you notice any faults, such as leaking taps or radiators that can't be turned off, write these in the maintenance book. This can be accessed online: login to the Emmanuel website as if you are registering for formal hall and click on the spanner icon.
- Although rooms like Old South Court are controlled by central thermostat, many rooms have individual dials, so it is easy to turn these down before opening a window!
