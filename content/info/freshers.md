# Fresher Reps 

##  Olivia Malmose O'Connor
Hey Future Freshers!

Iâ€™m Liv a second year HSPS student (Human Social and Political Sciences, donâ€™t worry most people have no idea what it is, itâ€™s basically politics). Iâ€™ve had an amazing first year at Emma and Iâ€™m so excited to be one of your freshersâ€™ reps this year!  

From ducklings in the spring, to the pool in the summer and the free laundry all year round youâ€™ve definitely chosen the right college. Emma is known as the friendly college for a reason, the accommodation is really sociable and the student run bar is a great place to relax in the evenings. But college is full of all sorts of amazing things to get involved in, Iâ€™ve loved playing for the Mixed Netball team this year but thereâ€™s also rowing, hockey, squash, the Freshersâ€™ Play, plenty of tea and cake events and so much more. And donâ€™t worry thereâ€™s still time amongst the hectic Cambridge schedule to keep up with Netflix (hit me up for any TV recommendations).  

We know moving to a new place can be quite daunting but weâ€™re here to answer any questions, no matter how small (I know I was weirdly stressed about the colour the walls of my room would be). Message me directly on Facebook or, once you get here Iâ€™m always around for a comforting tea and bagel.  

Weâ€™ve had so much fun planning your freshersâ€™ week and canâ€™t wait for you to arrive in October. Join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1117208578391378/"> Emmanuel College Freshersâ€™ Group </a> for more information coming soonâ€¦â€¦ (ooo exciting)â€¦â€¦  

Congratulations on getting your offer (Itâ€™s no mean feat and you should be extremely proud)! Hopefully youâ€™re excited to join us soon!

##  Callum Swanston

Hey Freshers!!

Iâ€™m Callum and Iâ€™ve really enjoyed my first year at Emma doing Geography.

I enjoy playing football for the Emma second team, a bit of rowing and Iâ€™m part of the college Green Ducks society. Iâ€™ve found sport a great thing to be involved in during my first year, just for general de-stressing but the social side canâ€™t be beat!. The good thing about college sport is that there is a level available to everyone, if youâ€™ve never played a certain sport or have been doing it for years.

Emmaâ€™s as central as you can be in the city, but the college grounds are still gorgeous, not to forget te free laundry! Cambridge can seem daunting because of its tradition and quirky ways, but Emma is a really welcoming environment that felt like home straight away. We have our own student-run college bar which is a great chill-out space in the evenings, right in the middle of Old South accommodation.

We have an official Emma freshersâ€™ page on Facebook where a lot of information about freshersâ€™ week will be posted, so please feel free to ask questions on the page or message myself and the other freps; Olivia, Sammie and Ellie - weâ€™re here to help after all, and weâ€™ve been through the same process. I hope youâ€™re buzzing for the super exciting freshersâ€™ week weâ€™ve got in store for you!

##  Ellie Cole

Hello, Hello, wonderful freshers!

Iâ€™m Ellie, I study Theology and am one of the four new reps for your freshersâ€™ week and beyond. In college, there is such a great atmosphere and loads to do but I have also really enjoyed getting the chance to meet people in different years at other colleges by being in a few plays over the course of first year and being on the CUADC committee.

I will admit that I chose Emma on a bit of a whim, having never seen it before I applied, but I am so glad I did because I canâ€™t imagine having picked anywhere better! We have ducks, the friendliest porters in the world, tea and cake regularly on offer and there was even a section in Cosmopolitan about how amazing it is that we get our laundry done for us for free (which effectively means there is nationwide recognition that our college is the best). Emma is unbelievably convenient in terms of location.I would say itâ€™s because weâ€™re really close to shops, supermarkets,lectures and clubs, but itâ€™s mainly because it less than 5 minutes from â€˜Van of Lifeâ€™, a haven that you will come to know and love all too quicklyâ€¦

I hope that you are all feeling excited about coming to university. It can be entirely terrifying but there are loads of people here to help to make sure that you feel as comfortable and at home as quickly as possible!Please feel free to contact any of the freps at any point, we really ar every friendly and unfeasibly keen so there is no question is too big or small (I emailed college before I came to ask what colour the blinds in my room would be so that I could choose cushions accordingly. Trust me when I say Iâ€™m not going to judge.)

See yâ€™all soon!

Lots of love xo


# International Fresher Reps

## Kristen Yang

Hello there! 

Iâ€™m Kristen, a second year economist coming from China.

So first a massive congrads to everyone who took whichever exams and succeeded, battled on whether to come abroad and the wilder side of yourself won, and is finally packing up for a new journey. Cambridge â€“ especially Emma! â€“ is a choice youâ€™re not gonna regret. There are just so many fantastic things going on here â€“ rowing, drama, may balls, college bar, paddock ducks, societies, formals, people... (and above all of course the international freshers week!!) Personally I was involved in rowing, Chinese debate, consulting etc. and they are all truly awesome experience. So be prepared for the start of an exciting adventure!

I know it might feel daunting for some of you to kiss goodbye to your mother tongue and get settled at a new place so far away from home (Talking about culture shocks, I arrived at Cambridge not knowing how to properly use knife and fork!...) But you will soon find out that Emma is such an easy place to make you feel home. It is called the friendliest college for a reason, and you will have a bunch of moms and dads in all kinds of family systems who are always ready to help. Besides, you can always come to us â€“ Simina and I will always be eager to help and chat for literally whatever you want! Feel free to add me on Facebook or drop me emails at dy271@cam.ac.uk !

Excited to meet yâ€™all very soon!

Lots of ifreppy love
Kristen xx




## Simina DragoÈ™

Hello freshers from all over the world and the UK!

Iâ€™m Simina, one of the international Freps (freshersâ€™ representatives) and I am soooo excited for International Freshersâ€™ Week!

I am originally from Transylvania, the Western part of Romania, but I lived in Germany as well and study now Education and German at Emma. I loved everything about my course this year and Emma made it even better. To be fair, I made an open application, but as soon as I got here, I realised that it was the best thing that could have happened- Emma really is the friendliest college!

This time last year I was already feeling a bit nervous about moving to another country, but do not worry- we are here for you and we will try and make your transition as enjoyable as possible. I first moved to another country on my own when I was 16 and became exchange student for a year, so donâ€™t worry about sharing any worries, fears, questions, I will probably be able to relate to them!

Emma has a great international community- Joanna, our international officer whom youâ€™ll all meet is also here to talk to you and there will be at least one society with other people from your country in Cambridge.

I guess that the most important thing you should know is that you are not alone here and you will be supported with all aspects of your transition from your home-country to Cambridge. Please feel free to contact me on Facebook or by e-mail ([sd756@cam.ac.uk](mailto:sd756@cam.ac.uk)) with really any kind of question!

I look forward to meeting you all and Iâ€™m sure that weâ€™ll have a great time together in September!

Lots of international love,

Simina
