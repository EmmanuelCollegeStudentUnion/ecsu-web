Our aim is to make ECSU.org.uk accessible to as many users as possible. Broadly, we strive to:

- Comply with web standards in order to make ECSU.org.uk compatible with the widest possible range of web browsers.
Provide alternative descriptions for users who choose not to or cannot view images.
- Not make use of proprietary technologies, such as Flash, QuickTime, and provide alternative content for users who choose not to or cannot view this content.
- We will also try to limit the amount of JavaScript our site relies on and provide alternatives for users without JavaScript.
- Most importantly, we will respond to any criticisms you may have about the accessibility of the site. Please [Contact Us](/info/feedback.html) in confidence if you wish to discuss any aspect of the site with respect to accessibility issues.
