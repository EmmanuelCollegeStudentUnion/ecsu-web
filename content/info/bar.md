The Emma bar is one of the best college bars in Cambridge. It's student-run, which makes for a great atmosphere and cheap prices. Anyone can work behind the bar and it's a good way to meet new people. <br/><br/>

The bar serves a wide range of draught and bottled beers and ciders, many spirits, soft drinks and snacks (now including popcorn) and normal closing time is 11:30. There are also Bar Extensions held in the bar, 2 in Michaelmas, 2 in Lent and 1 in Easter. These are usually fancy dress themed, where the bar stays open later, until 2am, and has amatuer student djs playing. There is also [Emma Ents](ents.html) on most Wednesday nights which varies each week from comedy nights to live bands.
