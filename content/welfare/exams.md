## Exam Tips



- Don't Panic!
- Think positively
- Take plenty of time out to do what you want to do, whether that's exercise, sunbathing or just chilling
- Try to get out of college now and then to remind yourself that there is another world out there
- If one exam goes badly, try to forget about it and focus on the next exam
- Don't talk about revision when you're going out with your friends
- Try to ignore people who stress you out
- Do things your way; don't be swayed by what other people are doing
- Remember, you are worth more than your exams
