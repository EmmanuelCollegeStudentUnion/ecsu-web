Emmanuel has a lively LGBT+ community, with regular events organised within college, such as formal halls and drinks. There are also a variety of  LGBT+ events organised across the university and within the town itself, so there is plenty to keep you occupied.

**ECSU LGBT+**

Emma has an LGBT+ rep, whose job it is to keep students informed about LGBT+ activities, and to provide a source of support to LGBT+ students. To be kept up-to-date on events within college, please email the college rep (lgbt-rep@ecsu.org.uk) to join their mailing list. 

If you are questioning your sexuality, or concerned about issues such as coming out or sexual health, then you can contact the  [LGBT+ Officer](lgbt_officer.html) (or indeed, the [Welfare Officers](female_welfare.html)) for confidential help or advice. 

**CUSU LGBT+**

CUSU LGBT+ is the Cambridge University Student's Union campaign for all members of the community at Cambridge. 

Find out more about this campaign and its events here: https://www.lgbt.cusu.cam.ac.uk/

CUSU LGBT+ run a LGBT+ Parenting Scheme for Freshers. It's a fantastic way to make new friends and meet people who can answer any questions you might have about LGBT+ (and indeed non-LGBT+) things in Cambridge. 

**LGBT+ Events Across Cambridge**

Glitterbomb is the weekly LGBT+ night-out in Cambridge, it runs every Tuesday in Vinyl ("Life").
