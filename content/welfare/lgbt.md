Emmanuel has a lively LGBT+ community, with regular events organised within college, such as formal halls and drink evenings. There is also a variety of events organised by the university, and within the town, so there is plenty to keep you occupied.

Emma has an LGBT+ rep, whose job it is to keep students informed about LGBT+ activities, and to provide a source of support. The current LGBT+ rep is Eddie Angel. At the start of each year the rep usually organises an informal welcome evening to introduce LGBT+ students to one another, and to offer more information about the gay scene in Cambridge. To be kept up-to-date on events within college, please email the college rep (lgbt-rep@ecsu.org.uk) to join their mailing list.

If you are questioning your sexuality, or concerned about issues such as coming out or sexual health, then you can contact the  [LGBT+ Officer](lgbt_officer.html) (or indeed, the [Welfare Officers](female_welfare.html)) for confidential help or advice. Condoms and dental dams are available from the ECSU Shop.
