Emmanuel has a lively LGBT+ community, with regular events including formals, swaps, LGBTea and Cake, film screenings and pre-Glitterbomb socials. There are also plenty of events happening in Cambridge more broadly, so there’s lots to keep you occupied!

# ECSU LGBT+

ECSU has an LGBT+ rep whose job is to provide welfare support to LGBT+ students, lobby college on issues affecting LGBT+ students, and run social events to create a fun and friendly LGBT+ community at Emma. You can find out who the current LGBT+ rep is here: http://www.ecsu.org.uk/pages/lgbt_officer.html. To keep up to date with what’s going on with Emma LGBT+ email lgbt-rep@ecsu.org.uk to join the secret mailing list or join the Emma LGBT+ Facebook group here: <https://www.facebook.com/groups/144142425731523/>

Since 2018 we’ve been running an Emma LGBT+ parenting scheme for freshers to help them get to know other LGBT+ people at Emma - keep an eye on your emails for the sign up sheet or contact the LGBT+ rep for more details!

If you are questioning your sexuality, or concerned about issues such as coming out or sexual health, then you can contact the LGBT+ Officer at [lgbt-rep@ecsu.org.uk](mailto:lgbt-rep@ecsu.org.uk) for confidential help and advice. Condoms are available from the ECSU Shop, and there should be condoms, dental dams and lube in the welfare cupboard in the pidge room.

# CUSU LGBT+

CUSU LGBT+ is one of the liberation campaigns run by the Cambridge University Students Union. One of the things they do is run an LGBT+ Parenting Scheme, where you’ll get buddied up with other LGBT+ students (your “siblings”) as well as two LGBT+ students in older years (your “parents”). It's a fantastic way to make new friends and meet people who can answer any questions you might have about LGBT+ (and indeed non-LGBT+) things in Cambridge. Visit [www.lgbt.cusu.cam.ac.uk/freshers](www.lgbt.cusu.cam.ac.uk/freshers) to find out more and sign up. Over the course of the year CUSU LGBT+ organises lots of different activities including coffee mornings, bar socials, brunches, film screenings, talks and more.

# LGBT+ Events Across Cambridge

Glitterbomb happens every Tuesday night at Vinyl (aka Life), which is on Sidney Street under the Waterstones - less than five minutes walk from college! It’s Cambridge’s only weekly LGBT+ night and is popular with students, featuring performances from local drag queens and dancers.

There are also other LGBT+ nights - Dot Cotton happens on the first Saturday of every month at Q Club, and there are also LGBT+ nights held at the Cornerhouse and at Junction.
