## Accessible Toilets

Queen's Building (gender neutral, accessible by lift); second floor of library (main door card activated, lift); Old South Court (one male, one female). 

## Social Spaces

The bottom level of the bar is currently wheelchair inaccessible, with 5 deep steps. Drinks can be ordered and then served to the upper level upon request; we are also in the process of campaigning for a wheelchair lift, and uncluttering the upper level as to provide more space.

The Old JCR is also inaccessible, with 40+ steps (the saving grace here is that it is not frequently in use).


## Food and Dining

There are no steps to the main area of hall (used for all meal times, including formal hall), and double doors. Upper hall, however, is inaccessible, with 26 steep steps, no lift, and double doors that are much more difficult to open. 

If you require accessibility adjustments in formal hall, please email Matt Carter (mc256@emma.cam.ac.uk). Please also make use of the online booking form by selecting "nut free", and using this space to clarify the adjustments (the information you provide will be circulated to all catering staff).  


## General grounds

The physical ground of college is generally flat and unslippery. There is, however, an area leading up to the library that is gravelled, and would really benefit from a proper path. 

The porter's lodge and the pidge room are inaccessible. The porters will deliver mail personally to those who are affected by this (contact email for Head Porter: [dg407@emma.cam.ac.uk](mailto:dg407@emma.cam.ac.uk)).
