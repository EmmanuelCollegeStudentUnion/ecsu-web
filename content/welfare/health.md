Life at Emma demands a lot of us physically and mentally. Unless we give our bodies the best, we can not expect the same of our minds, so this site is to let you know what your body needs to perform. Nutrition is something we all need an awareness of, and most of us know generally what we need, whether its from what makes us feel good or from hazy food tech lessons in year 7. This covers the basics, and there is more information online, just be careful - there is a lot of misinformed material on the web.

A good diet is central to overall good health. So look at the facts, to help you make realistic, informed choices both in Sainsburys and Hall!

Yes! You can eat healthily very reasonably, and there are always options in Hall to help you keep a balance. 
You can combine Jacket potatoes with hot and salad bar options.

Don't forget about this mini-cheeses and milkshakes by the tills.

## What is a healthy diet?

A healthy diet is a diet based on breads, potatoes, and other cereals and is rich in fruits and vegetables. A healthy diet will include moderate amounts of milk and dairy products, meat, fish or meat/milk alternatives, and limited amounts of foods containing fat or sugar.

No single food can provide all the essential nutrients that the body needs. Therefore, it is important to consume a wide variety of foods to provide adequate intakes of vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre, which are important for health.

You should choose a variety of foods from each of these four food groups every day:
- Bread, other cereals and potatoes
- Fruit and vegetables
- Milk and dairy foods
- Meat, fish and alternatives
Foods in the fifth group, i.e. foods containing fat and foods containing sugar, can be eaten sparingly as part of a healthy balanced diet but should not be eaten instead of foods from the other food groups, or too often or in large amounts. Having a variety of foods in the diet is important for health - it is not necessary to follow the model at every meal, but rather over a day or two.

## Vitamins and Minerals

If you maintain a healthy balance in your diet then you should also be getting the vitamins and minerals that you require. These are required in relatively small doses, but are vital all the same. One key mineral particularly important to women is iron. A very significant proportion of younger women (2-3 out of 5) have intakes below the national suggested levels - the figures are about  9 mg a day for men 15 mg a day for women. 

This can result in fatigue, anaemia and other symptoms, so make sure you get your iron! Iron is found in both meat and vegetable sources, but it's a good idea to eat food containing lots of vitamin C at the same time as you eat food containing iron from non-meat sources, because this helps the body absorb the iron. So you could have fruit juice or fruit with your (fortified) breakfast cereal, or vegetables with your beans, nuts or rice. 
Women who lose a lot of blood during their monthly period may want to think about taking iron supplements - these are available at places like Boots, but it would be advisable to consult your GP first.
