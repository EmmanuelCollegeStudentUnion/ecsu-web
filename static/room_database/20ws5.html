      <td>2016</td><td>Really great room - absolutely huge and lots of natural light. Lots of shelving, a couple of chairs and a sofa. The main bathroom is just across the hall. House has been refurbished so nice carpets and relatively recently painted walls. The kitchen facilities are the only downside as this house only has a tiny galley kitchen with no hob (only combi oven) but the house next door is connected and has hobs. The house has two loos and two showers.</td>

      <td>2014</td><td>This is such a nice room! The house has been recently refurbished, the toilet and shower are just across the landing, the gyp room in the basement has a microwave and combi oven, and the kitchen next-door has 2 hobs, a combi oven, a table and chairs. The heating works well, the windows let in lots of light, the room is massive and it's close to college. I've had no problems here, and would really recommend it. Only downside would maybe be the cooking facilities - 2 hobs between everyone in 19 and 20 is not much, but that's really the only problem with living here!</td>

    <tr>
      <td>2010</td><td>This is a lovely room, very big and with two windows that let a lot of sunlight in.  The walls and carpet are ok, but could do with revamping, and there isn&#039;t as much storage space as in a college room, but I haven&#039;t had any difficulties.  There are more chairs than will ever be needed and the heating works really well.  In the house there are two toilets, one shower and a bath with a shower attachment.  The kitchen on this side has a microwave combi oven and the kitchen under 19 has a hob.  Tesco Express has just opened at the back, so being out of college is not a problem.  Overall this has been a great room.</td>
