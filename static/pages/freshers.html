  <h1>Fresher Reps </h1>
  <img src="../images/freps/liv.png" width='150' align="left" id="imgborder1"><h3> Olivia Malmose O'Connor</h3><p>
    Hey Future Freshers!
</p>
<p>
    Iâ€™m Liv a second year HSPS student (Human Social and Political Sciences,
    donâ€™t worry most people have no idea what it is, itâ€™s basically politics).
    Iâ€™ve had an amazing first year at Emma and Iâ€™m so excited to be one of your
    freshersâ€™ reps this year!
</p>
<p>
    From ducklings in the spring, to the pool in the summer and the free
    laundry all year round youâ€™ve definitely chosen the right college. Emma is
    known as the friendly college for a reason, the accommodation is really
    sociable and the student run bar is a great place to relax in the evenings.
    But college is full of all sorts of amazing things to get involved in, Iâ€™ve
    loved playing for the Mixed Netball team this year but thereâ€™s also rowing,
    hockey, squash, the Freshersâ€™ Play, plenty of tea and cake events and so
    much more. And donâ€™t worry thereâ€™s still time amongst the hectic Cambridge
    schedule to keep up with Netflix (hit me up for any TV recommendations).
</p>
<p>
    We know moving to a new place can be quite daunting but weâ€™re here to
    answer any questions, no matter how small (I know I was weirdly stressed
    about the colour the walls of my room would be). Message me directly on
    Facebook or, once you get here Iâ€™m always around for a comforting tea and
    bagel.
</p>
<p>
    Weâ€™ve had so much fun planning your freshersâ€™ week and canâ€™t wait for you
    to arrive in October. Join the
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1117208578391378/">
        Emmanuel College Freshersâ€™ Group
    </a>
    for more information coming soonâ€¦â€¦ (ooo exciting)â€¦â€¦
</p>
<p>
    Congratulations on getting your offer (Itâ€™s no mean feat and you should be
    extremely proud)! Hopefully youâ€™re excited to join us soon!
</p>

    Hey Freshers!!
<br />
    <br />
    Iâ€™m Sammie and Iâ€™m one of the four fantastic Frepresentatives (Freshersâ€™
    Rep) for you all this year!
<br />
    <br />
    Congrats to all of you for making it here, it was worth every second of
    work I promise. Emma is an amazing place to be and I hope you guys have as
    great a first year as I did. Iâ€™m studying History of Art but I also do a
    lot of not studying; the opportunities in Emma and the wider university are
    incredible so you really can find anything to get involved with.
</p>
<p>
    Whilst Emma is awesome, it can be a huge change so weâ€™re here to make your
    first few weeks in Cambridge as smooth and easy as possible. Please feel
    free to get in touch with absolutely anything â€“ you can contact me on
Facebook or email me at    <a href="mailto:sjr204@cam.ac.uk">sjr204@cam.ac.uk</a>. Also make sure to
    join the Emmanuel College Freshersâ€™ 2017-18 Page on Facebook for updates
    and other cool stuff.
</p>
<p>
    So excited to meet you all and get hyped for Freshersâ€™ Week and an amazing
    year! Frep love x

    Hey Freshers!!
</p>
<p>
    Iâ€™m Callum and Iâ€™ve really enjoyed my first year at Emma doing Geography.
</p>
<p>
    I enjoy playing football for the Emma second team, a bit of rowing and Iâ€™m
    part of the college Green Ducks society. Iâ€™ve found sport a great thing to
    be involved in during my first year, just for general de-stressing but the
    social side canâ€™t be beat!. The good thing about college sport is that
    there is a level available to everyone, if youâ€™ve never played a certain
    sport or have been doing it for years.
</p>
<p>
    Emmaâ€™s as central as you can be in the city, but the college grounds are
    still gorgeous, not to forget te free laundry! Cambridge can seem daunting
    because of its tradition and quirky ways, but Emma is a really welcoming
    environment that felt like home straight away. We have our own student-run
    college bar which is a great chill-out space in the evenings, right in the
    middle of Old South accommodation.
</p>
<p>
    We have an official Emma freshersâ€™ page on Facebook where a lot of
    information about freshersâ€™ week will be posted, so please feel free to ask
    questions on the page or message myself and the other freps; Olivia, Sammie
    and Ellie - weâ€™re here to help after all, and weâ€™ve been through the same
    process. I hope youâ€™re buzzing for the super exciting freshersâ€™ week weâ€™ve
    got in store for you!
</p>

    Hello, Hello, wonderful freshers!
</p>
<p>
    Iâ€™m Ellie, I study Theology and am one of the four new reps for your
    freshersâ€™ week and beyond. In college, there is such a great atmosphere and
    loads to do but I have also really enjoyed getting the chance to meet
    people in different years at other colleges by being in a few plays over
    the course of first year and being on the CUADC committee.
</p>
<p>
    I will admit that I chose Emma on a bit of a whim, having never seen it
    before I applied, but I am so glad I did because I canâ€™t imagine having
    picked anywhere better! We have ducks, the friendliest porters in the
    world, tea and cake regularly on offer and there was even a section in
    Cosmopolitan about how amazing it is that we get our laundry done for us
    for free (which effectively means there is nationwide recognition that our
    college is the best). Emma is unbelievably convenient in terms of location.
    I would say itâ€™s because weâ€™re really close to shops, supermarkets,
    lectures and clubs, but itâ€™s mainly because it less than 5 minutes from
    â€˜Van of Lifeâ€™, a haven that you will come to know and love all too quicklyâ€¦
</p>
<p>
    I hope that you are all feeling excited about coming to university. It can
    be entirely terrifying but there are loads of people here to help to make
    sure that you feel as comfortable and at home as quickly as possible!
    Please feel free to contact any of the freps at any point, we really are
    very friendly and unfeasibly keen so there is no question is too big or
    small (I emailed college before I came to ask what colour the blinds in my
    room would be so that I could choose cushions accordingly. Trust me when I
    say Iâ€™m not going to judge.)
</p>
<p>
    See yâ€™all soon!
</p>
<p>
    Lots of love xo

<h1>International Fresher Reps</h1>
     <img src="../images/freps/Kristen.jpg" width='150' align="left" id="imgborder1"><h3>Kristen Yang</h3><p>
   Hello there! Iâ€™m Kristen, a second year economist coming from China.<br/><br/>

So first a massive congrads to everyone who took whichever exams and succeeded, battled on whether to come abroad and the wilder side of yourself won, and is finally packing up for a new journey. Cambridge â€“ especially Emma! â€“ is a choice youâ€™re not gonna regret. There are just so many fantastic things going on here â€“ rowing, drama, may balls, college bar, paddock ducks, societies, formals, people... (and above all of course the international freshers week!!) Personally I was involved in rowing, Chinese debate, consulting etc. and they are all truly awesome experience. So be prepared for the start of an exciting adventure!<br/><br/>

I know it might feel daunting for some of you to kiss goodbye to your mother tongue and get settled at a new place so far away from home (Talking about culture shocks, I arrived at Cambridge not knowing how to properly use knife and fork!...) But you will soon find out that Emma is such an easy place to make you feel home. It is called the friendliest college for a reason, and you will have a bunch of moms and dads in all kinds of family systems who are always ready to help. Besides, you can always come to us â€“ Simina and I will always be eager to help and chat for literally whatever you want! Feel free to add me on Facebook or drop me emails at dy271@cam.ac.uk !<br/><br/>

Excited to meet yâ€™all very soon!<br/>
<br/>
Lots of ifreppy love<br/>
Kristen xx

  <p>Hello freshers from all over the world and the UK!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;m Simina, one of the international Freps (freshers&rsquo; representatives) and I am soooo excited for International Freshers&rsquo; Week!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am originally from Transylvania, the Western part of Romania, but I lived in Germany as well and study now Education and German at Emma. I loved everything about my course this year and Emma made it even better. To be fair, I made an open application, but as soon as I got here, I realised that it was the best thing that could have happened- Emma really is the friendliest college!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This time last year I was already feeling a bit nervous about moving to another country, but do not worry- we are here for you and we will try and make your transition as enjoyable as possible. I first moved to another country on my own when I was 16 and became exchange student for a year, so don&rsquo;t worry about sharing any worries, fears, questions, I will probably be able to relate to them!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Emma has a great international community- Joanna, our international officer whom you&rsquo;ll all meet is also here to talk to you and there will be at least one society with other people from your country in Cambridge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I guess that the most important thing you should know is that you are not alone here and you will be supported with all aspects of your transition from your home-country to Cambridge. Please feel free to contact me on Facebook or by e-mail (<a href="mailto:sd756@cam.ac.uk">sd756@cam.ac.uk</a>) with really any kind of question!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I look forward to meeting you all and I&rsquo;m sure that we&rsquo;ll have a great time together in September!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lots of international love,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Simina</p>
