								<span class="date">November 27, 2016</span></center><br/>
                                    <p>Christ's College is one of New Zealand's leading independent boys' schools. Situated in the heart of Christchurch, the South Island's largest city, it has a student roll of 630 boys. Further details about Christ's can be found at www.christscollege.com. <br/><br/>

The position 
The position is a year-long commitment beginning in mid-July 2017. The primary role of the English tutor is to become fully involved in all aspects of the English Department. This is a large, vibrant department with extensive opportunities for the tutor ranging from working with Scholarship-level students, to providing one-on-one tuition, and assisting with administrative duties. Christ's offers classes for boys from Year 9 through to Year 13 and caters to a wide range of academic abilities (as is typical for a secondary school in New Zealand). The English tutor will have the opportunity to work with many of these students. 
<br/><br/>
The main requirement for this role is a passion for English and appropriate academic expertise. However, an interest in teaching and working with students is just as important. The position is ideal for anyone considering teaching as a profession and as a constructive and enjoyable way to spend a year in New Zealand. 
<br/><br/>
Extra-curricular involvement
The school also places a strong emphasis on extra-curricular activities, and tutors are strongly encouraged to take part in this aspect of college life. The college has a thriving extra-curricular programme. Previous tutors have produced student plays, played in the school orchestra, coached sports teams ranging from rugby to MTB, and run other societies as diverse as debating and creative writing. 
<br/><br/>
Other perks
There are fantastic opportunities for the tutor in school during term time. These include skiing with the boarders at weekends, going on numerous overnight tramping (hiking) trips with students, and engaging with the full range of college activities and events. 
<br/><br/>
Tutors do not have boarding duties. As such, they are also free to take advantage of their evenings and weekends during term time. During the vacations there is, of course, the opportunity to travel extensively. Tutors enjoy approximately 3 weeks of holidays in October, 8 weeks December-January, and another 3 weeks in April. 
<br/><br/>
Compensation<br/><br/>
                                        <ul>
<li>	Salary: approximately NZ$20,000 per annum.</li>
<li>	Flights: Christ's College will refund the cost of the tutor's UK-Christchurch return flights up to NZ$3,000. </li>
<li>	Accommodation: provided on-site in a furnished college flat. Costs are met by the school; this includes wireless internet and a weekly cleaning service. </li>
<li>	Meals: provided in the dining hall during term time. The tutors' flat does also feature its own kitchen.</li>
<li>	Laptop loan: tutors are loaned an Apple laptop for the duration of their employment with Christ's College. </li>
</ul>
The current tutor is Leanne Greenfield. All queries should be directed to her at lgreenfield@christscollege.com. 
<br/><br/>
Applications should include a CV and a letter of introduction with the applicant's thoughts on their strengths, suitability for the position and details of two referees. 
<br/><br/>
Please send applications to the current tutor by email. Applications will close on 31 January 2016. Early applications are encouraged.
