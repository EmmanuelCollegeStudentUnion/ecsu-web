        Has someone gone out of their way to make your day?
        Does someone consistently help others?
        Do you basically just like someone but can't be bothered to complement them yourself?

      <br>If you answered
      <b>'yes'</b> to any of the questions above, then the Wonderful Person of the Week tool is for you!

        Wonderful Person of the Week is an initiative to recognise good deeds in the Emma Community. Students are
        encouraged to write a small, anonymous note saying what someone else has done to make them smile during the week.
        The best nomination per week will be announced by the welfare team via Facebook, and the student in question will
        receive a goodie bag in their pidge!
      </p>
